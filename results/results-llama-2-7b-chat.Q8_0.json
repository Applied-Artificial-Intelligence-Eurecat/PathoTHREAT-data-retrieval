Vibrio cholerae O1 Ogawa carrying ctxA was found in two of twenty-five river water samples and one of six wastewater samples.

Five days of diarrhea was required to meet the case definition to exclude persons with sporadic illness caused by common bacterial or viral pathogens, which is usually of shorter duration (2). Stool specimens collected in 10% Formalin were examined for G. lamblia cysts by the Formalin-ether concentration method (14). Stool specimens were not examined for cryptosporidia. The residue obtained by pumping 150 gallons (ca. 568 liters) of untreated park water through a wound Orlon filter (minimum pore size, 1 Fsm) was kindly examined for G. lamblia cysts by Judith F. Sauch at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Laboratory, Cincinnati, Ohio, using sequential immunofluorescence-phase-contrast microscopy (13). Park water also was tested for coliform bacteria by standard methods (1). All 122 park residents completed questionnaires. One or more stool specimens were obtained from 71 (58%) residents; two or more were obtained from 18 (25%) of these. Thirty-seven (30%) residents had a case of outbreak-related giardiasis: 23 residents had G. lamblia cysts detected in stool, and an additional 14 residents had diarrhea lasting 25 days but either their stools were not tested or cysts were not identified. The peak number of cases occurred 2 weeks before the initial interviews and extended over a period of 2 months (Fig. 1). Case residents resided in 23 (52%) of the 44 trailers, and there was no apparent clustering of cases in any portion of the park. The attack rates for males and females were similar. Eight (21%) of 38 residents aged <20 years and 29 (35%) of 84 residents aged .20 years met the case definition.",
            "The article mentions that \"levels of serum antibody to G. lamblia, particularly IgA, may be useful in determining exposure to G. lamblia-contaminated water and illness from G. lamblia during waterborne outbreaks of diarrheal illness.\" This suggests that testing for antibodies in the blood may be a useful tool for identifying individuals who have been exposed to Giardia lamblia and may be at risk for developing giardiasis in the future.",

The storm surge caused flooding in residential areas, damaging the piped water supply system and submerging ponds and tube wells with saline water. The affected villagers had to drink water from non-submerged ponds, which led to an outbreak of acute watery diarrhea. The outbreak started in the fourth week of May and lasted until August 2009, with two peaks in the second and fourth weeks of June. The median age of the case patients was 25 years, and 486 (45%) were female. The attack rate among 0-4-year-olds was higher than among other age groups. The villagers broke the repaired water pipelines to draw water nearer to their houses and used plastic/polythene to close the broken pipeline after use. Piped water was not tested regularly to check its quality, and two tap-water specimens collected during the study had coliform counts of 1600 and 1800 MPN/100 ml. Water collected from stored water specimens in affected households had coliform counts ranging from 1800 to 220 MPN/100 ml. Open-air defecation among children was common practice, and villagers had a belief that the stool of children was non-infectious. The block authority provided medical camps, daily chlorination, and health education regarding the danger of breached water pipelines and chlorine treatment at the household level, which led to a gradual decrease in incidence and the end of the outbreak in the fourth week of August.",
