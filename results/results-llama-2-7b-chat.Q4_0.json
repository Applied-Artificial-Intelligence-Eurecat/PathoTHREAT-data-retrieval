The mean age of affected individuals was 23.57 19.95 years, and 262 cases (36.95%) were pediatric cases. The main suspected cause of the outbreak was the waterborne transmission of Norovirus, which was confirmed through PCR testing of stool specimens. The water specimens from Drosero well revealed a high load of bacterial pathogens, including E. coli, Enterococcus, Clostridium, and Psudomonas spp., while the water specimens from Paradisos source did not contain bacterial pathogens. The event led to the announcement by the Regional Public Health Bureau that water use was forbidden and recommended frequent handwashing and the use of masks and gloves before approaching potentially soiled surfaces. High-level chlorination (10 ppm or 10 mg/L for several hours) was applied to Drosero well as a measure of adequate disinfection.",

The initial contamination event probably occurred up to 10 weeks previously. While sewage leakage from a residential area is now considered to be the probable source of contamination, during the episode waste from one particular septic tank was thought to be a possible source. Genotyping of cysts from the septic tank demonstrated that they were assemblage A cysts, although the sequences were not identical to any previously published sequences. For the \\u0001-giardin gene, the closest published subgenotype was subgenotype A3; for the gdh gene, the closest published subgenotype was subgenotype A2. Genotyping of cysts from 21 patient samples revealed that they were assemblage B cysts; thus, the septic tank was unlikely to be the contamination source. Sequencing of the \\u0001-giardin and gdh genes from patient samples and a comparison of the sequences gave complex results. For the \\u0001-giardin gene, three isolates had sequences identical to subgenotype B3 sequences. However, other isolates had between one and four single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). For the gdh gene, none of the sequences were identical to the sequence published for subgenotype B3, and the sequences had between one and three SNPs. One isolate, which was identical to subgenotype B3 at the \\u0001-giardin gene, was more similar to subgenotype B2 at the gdh gene.
