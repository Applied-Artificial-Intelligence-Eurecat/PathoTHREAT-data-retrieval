            "The contamination event involved two simultaneous outbreaks in the Soderhamn municipality during December 2002 and January 2003. The first outbreak was of verified Campylobacter infections, while the second was a larger outbreak of self-reported acute intestinal illness (AGI). The water supply was suspected as the source of both outbreaks due to several reasons: a previous waterborne outbreak had occurred in the municipality at a similar time of year; a contaminated routine well water sample with one E. coli had been analysed two weeks prior to the arrival of the investigation team; and it was felt that the high incidence of self-reported AGI cases in the population could be related to both outbreaks. The investigation team consisted of experts from the Swedish Institute for Infectious Disease Control (SMI) and the Environmental Health Protection Board at S\\u00f6derhamn. The investigation team conducted a comprehensive investigation of both outbreaks using a combination of epidemiological, microbiological, and environmental investigative methods. The investigation team collected data on demography, clinical signs and symptoms, food outlets, food items and type and amount of water consumed from both cases and controls using a postal questionnaire. The investigation team also collected water samples from both the public water supply and private wells for microbiological analysis at both the local and national laboratories. The investigation team also conducted environmental investigations of both the public water supply and private wells for potential sources of contamination using standard environmental investigative methods. The investigation team used both descriptive and inferential statistical methods to analyse the data collected from both cases and controls. The investigation team also used both univariate and multivariate statistical methods to identify potential risk factors for both outbreaks. The investigation team also used both sensitivity and specificity analyses to evaluate the performance of the diagnostic tests used to identify both outbreaks. The investigation team also used both cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses to evaluate the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of the interventions used to control both outbreaks.

            "During the monitoring phase, water specimens were collected from Cheptui River and from borehole pumps for bacteriological culture identification of V. cholerae using a standard procedure. The procedure involved making a pad from sterile gauze, placing it into a clean funnel, and filtering 2 l of water specimen through the gauze. The gauze pad with debris was then immersed into 125 mls of double strength alkaline peptone water in sterile screw cap glass conical flasks and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 18\u201324 hours. The procedure was repeated for all other water samples, taking care to avoid cross-contamination between samples by changing funnels and employing aseptic techniques. Using a 10 \u03bcl wire loop, a loop full of the enriched culture was picked from just beneath the surface of the broth and streaked onto thiosulfate-citrate-bile salts-sucrose (TCBS) agar and incubated aerobically at 37 \u00b0C for 18\u201324 hours. The gauze pad was left suspended in the alkaline peptone water for at least 2\u20135 days for possible repeat analyses. Presumptive colonies (yellow, shiny colonies, 2\u20134mm in diameter) were identified using standard procedures. The V.cholera isolates were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility using modified Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method. The results were interpreted according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines. The hygiene conditions at sources of drinking water and water for household use were assessed using standard procedures. Human activities likely to result into river water contamination along the Cheptui River and around the few bore hole water pumps were assessed using standard procedures. Human waste disposal practices in the communities were also assessed using standard procedures.",

Telephone contact with the principal medical facility serving the five communities described above showed that office and emergency-room visits for gastrointestinal disease had risen sharply March 6-11; review of emergency room records showed that the increase was entirely in residents of Eagle-Vail and Avon, not of Vail itself or the other two communities in the service area of the medical facility. Eagle-Vail and Avon share a unique three-digit telephone exchange. A household telephone survey was performed on March 13 and 14 by calling every 6th listed residential number in that exchange until 48 households were reached; about 80 households in the sample did not answer on multiple attempts in a 24-hour period, and 20 were disconnected. All persons at home at the time of the call were interviewed about illness in the previous 30 days with diarrhea (three or more loose stools per day) and/or vomiting. They were also asked to answer the same questions for household members who were not at home. The data were analyzed using x2 for trend and confidence intervals around relative risks using the calculator programs of Rothman and Boice.4 Laboratory records of the Vail Mountain Medical Center for the period March -25, 1981 were reviewed. In addition, five ill adults seen between March 12-22 at the medical center for diarrheal illness with onsets March 7-20 submitted stools that were examined for the presence of virus particles by routine electron microscopy (EM) at the Health Effects Research Laboratory, US Environmental Protection Agency, Cincinnati, Ohio. Acute and convalescent (three weeks post illness) sera from six persons who were ill during the same time period were tested for viral antibody by immune electron microscopy (IEM) using a rotavirus preparation from the stool of one individual containing large numbers of particles. The individual sera were examined under code after overnight incubation with the rotavirus preparation. Each serum was rated 0-4+ according to the amount of aggregation and antibody coating of particles observed. The serum pairs were identified after examination and a significant sero response was indicated by a four-fold or greater increase in antibody titer against the virus tested. The same five stools from ill adults were also tested for heatlabile and heat-stable enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli at the Centers for Disease Control by described techniques. The water treatment plant at Eagle-Vail and the sewage treatment plant at Vail were inspected within a few days after the outbreak came to attention. Forty-eight households were reached, with 128 residents, of whom over 80% were adults. All but five residents were over two years old and only a handful were over age 50.

Over the 18 months following the outbreak, costs of improvements to ensure a reliable safe water supply are estimated at over $1 million. The plant will have much greater storage for treated water and a third filter, so the filters can be run at a steady rate, and chemical treatment will precede filtration. These improvements will bring the water treatment plant in compliance with current Colorado Department of Health requirements, which have become more stringent since the original plant was designed and built.",

            "The contamination event was first discovered when an outbreak of gastro-enteritis occurred in the community of Eleoussa between 11 and 22 October 1996. The peak of the epidemic occurred during the first 3 days (11-13 October). The highest risk of developing gastro-enteritis was observed in the age group 0-14 years (41.4%). The contamination was later confirmed by the isolation of Shigella sonnei from both water samples and faeces of patients. Control measures were implemented on the second day of the outbreak. Environmental conditions suggest that contamination of the water system occurred by groundwater. In 1996, a community water system served almost the whole population of the town, using groundwater from a single borehole as one source. The system was not regularly chlorinated. The sewage network was in a satisfactory condition. One 300-ml water sample was collected about four times per year, as routine, and submitted to the Laboratory of Hygiene of the University of Ioannina, which tested the samples for total and faecal coliforms using the membrane filtration method [6]. The first day after the outbreak had been recognized (11 October 1996) the Laboratory of Hygiene collected three samples from the water distribution system, one sample from the tank, and one sample from the pumping station. On 13 October a 1-l sample was collected from the pumping station. This sample was filtered and tested for the presence of salmonella and shigella, using an enrichment technique with sterile 0-1% peptone water. Serological identification was performed using the slide agglutination technique with shigella antisera (polyvalent and type-specific sera) [6, 7]. The identification of the responsible micro-organism was based on a sample from the pumping station because local authorities proceeded to an immediate chlorination of the water-distribution system and the tank.

            "The exact source of contamination was not definitively identified during the investigation. However, it is believed that the contamination may have originated from cooling towers located in the affected area. This hypothesis is supported by the detection of Legionella pneumophila serogroup 2 (Lp2) in cooling tower samples collected during the investigation. It is important to note that this hypothesis is still speculative and further investigation is needed to confirm this hypothesis and identify the exact source of contamination.",
            "The contamination event was first discovered when an increase in pneumonia cases was reported in a local hospital in Brescia province, Italy. The cases were initially diagnosed using urinary antigen tests, which all came back negative. However, when respiratory secretions were analysed using real-time PCR, Legionella pneumophila was detected in several cases. This led to an epidemiological investigation to identify the source of the contamination event. The investigation revealed that the contamination event was likely due to the presence of Legionella pneumophila in cooling towers located in the affected area. This highlights the importance of implementing effective water management practices and regular monitoring for Legionella pneumophila in cooling towers and other water systems to prevent contamination events and protect public health.",

            "Two fatalities were associated with the contamination event.",
            "Legionella pneumophila was identified in both clinical and environmental samples. The serogroups of L. pneumophila were determined using monoclonal antibodies specific for each Lp serogroup. Genotyping by sequence-based typing was used to identify the sequence type and Lp1 colonies were sub-grouped by monoclonal antibodies, according to the Dresden panel.",
            "The symptoms associated with Legionella contamination include cough, shortness of breath, fever, muscle aches, and headaches. These symptoms can develop within 2-14 days after exposure to contaminated water or aerosols. It is important to note that not all individuals exposed to Legionella will develop symptoms. The risk of developing symptoms is highest for individuals with underlying health conditions, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic bronchitis, or emphysema), or who are immunocompromised, such as individuals undergoing chemotherapy or radiation therapy, or those with HIV/AIDS or other immunodeficiency disorders. Additionally, older adults and smokers are also at increased risk for developing symptoms after exposure to Legionella.",

            "The investigation was conducted through a multidisciplinary team consisting of public health professionals, epidemiologists, medical doctors, and microbiologists. The team collected water samples from various sources including drinking water taps, cooling towers, irrigation canals, and the Chiese river itself. The team also collected respiratory secretions and sera from confirmed cases for laboratory testing. The team used various laboratory techniques including culture, real-time PCR, and serology to identify and confirm the presence of Legionella bacteria in the water and respiratory samples. The team also used epidemiological analysis and mapping techniques to identify potential sources and transmission routes of the Legionella bacteria. The team shared their findings and recommendations with the local health authorities and other relevant stakeholders to ensure appropriate and effective control measures were implemented to prevent further transmission and outbreaks of Legionella bacteria.",

A confirmed case is defined as a person who has been diagnosed with LD by a laboratory using at least one of the following diagnostic methods: urinary antigen test (UAT), culture of respiratory secretions or lung tissue, or detection of Legionella antibodies in serum or urine. Additionally, a confirmed case must have a compatible clinical presentation, which includes fever (temperature >38\u00b0C), cough, and pneumonia. The case definition also includes a probable case, which is defined as a person who has been diagnosed with LD by a clinician based on a compatible clinical presentation and epidemiological linkage to a confirmed case or a known outbreak. However, for the cohort study, only confirmed cases were included.",

Disinfection of all industrial and non-industrial plants that might give rise to aerosols was requested. A correct use of the Chiese river water was recommended, taking into account periods of drought and guaranteeing the minimum vital flow for the ecological balance of the river itself. The European Legionnaires' disease Surveillance Network was promptly informed by email in order to identify LD cases among European citizens who had travelled in the epidemic area. From 18 October 2018, the incidence of LD cases returned to the level of the previous years, indicating that the epidemic was over and demonstrating the effectiveness of the control measures applied. One of the greatest points of criticism faced during the outbreak investigation was the detection of Lp2 in cooling towers, which highlighted the lack of a cooling tower register. As a result, the local health authority decided to enact a regional law aimed at implementing a mandatory notification of cooling towers, as recommended by the national Legionella guidelines.",

The outbreak was identified through the notification of confirmed Legionnaires' Disease (LD) cases and high levels of Legionella bacteria detected in cooling tower (CT) samples from the plant. The investigation identified plant A as the most likely source of the outbreak and implicated contaminated CTs as the primary mode of transmission. The investigation also identified risk factors for acquiring LD, including smoking, silicosis, and spending 1100 min outdoors daily. The investigation implemented control measures to prevent further transmission and evaluated their effectiveness. The investigation also performed environmental investigations, including water sampling and site inspections, to identify potential sources of contamination and implement control measures to prevent further transmission.

It is important to note that not all cases of Legionnaires' disease are caused by contaminated aerosols. Some cases may be caused by drinking water contaminated with Legionella bacteria or by exposure to contaminated whirlpool spas or cooling towers. However, in the context of the Legionnaires' disease outbreak in Harnes, France, in 2003-2004, it is believed that the majority of cases were caused by contaminated aerosols emitted from cooling towers located at a petrochemical plant in Harnes. This is based on the identification of high levels of Legionella bacteria in cooling tower water samples collected from the plant, as well as the detection of identical strains of Legionella bacteria in environmental samples collected from the plant and in clinical isolates obtained from confirmed cases of Legionnaires' disease. These findings strongly suggest that the cooling towers at the petrochemical plant in Harnes were the source of the Legionnaires' disease outbreak in the area.",

The microbiological investigation involved isolating and identifying Legionella bacteria from environmental samples using standard procedures and identifying them to the species and serogroup level using direct immunofluorescence and random amplified polymorphic DNA polymerase chain reaction techniques. The pulsed-field gel electrophoresis-SfiI method was used to analyze the genetic relatedness of Legionella bacteria isolated from environmental samples and clinical isolates using standard procedures. The Gaussian dispersion model, ADMS 3, was used to simulate the dispersion of presumably infectious aerosols from the CTs of plant A based on emission parameters and hourly meteorological data during the corresponding period.

            "The case definition used for the cohort study is a confirmed case of Legionnaires' disease, defined as a person who (1) had radiologically confirmed pneumonia and laboratory evidence of infection with Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 (Lp-1), (2) became ill between 1 November 2003 and 31 January 2004, and (3) lived in or visited Harnes or its neighboring communes during the 10 days before illness onset. Persons who had been hospitalized or traveling continuously outside of the community during the 10 days before illness onset were excluded from the study. In France, physicians and microbiologists are required to notify confirmed and probable cases of Legionnaires' disease to local health authorities. In addition, an active search for cases was initiated among physicians, laboratories, and hospitals in Harnes and its adjacent communes on 2 December 2003 and was extended to communes located within a 12-km radius of Harnes (defined as the epidemic zone) on 30 December 2003. All cases were interviewed using a standardized questionnaire to collect information on current illness, place of residence, mobility, and personal characteristics and environmental factors known to be associated with Legionnaires' disease. Matched case-control studies were initiated to identify risk factors for illness. Confirmed cases living in communes where at least 2 cases had been identified were included in the studies. Controls were randomly selected from the municipal electoral list. Three controls were matched to each case, according to commune of residence, age (10-year groups), and sex. Cases and controls were interviewed face-to-face within 3-4 weeks after illness onset. A standardized questionnaire with approximately 150 variables was used to solicit information on medical history and personal characteristics, housing and living conditions, and daily outdoor activities and exposures during the 10 days before illness onset. To estimate cumulative exposure to outdoor air, subjects were asked about each outing (defined as an exit from the home), means of transportation used (car, bike, foot, etc.), and time spent in each place during the period. On the basis of preliminary univariate analysis (P < .25) and biological or epidemiological plausibility, variables were selected for a conditional logistic regression model (using backward elimination), to estimate risk factors for illness. Statistical analysis was performed using STATA (version 8.2; StataCorp). Environmental investigation was conducted to identify potential sources of Legionella bacteria contamination. Household water from cases' homes was systematically sampled. Locations of cooling towers and other industrial cooling systems in the epidemic zone were obtained from a census performed by the local environmental authority. Site inspections, record reviews, and water sampling were performed on these installations. To identify potential reservoirs of Legionella bacteria, cooling water, surface water, soil, and air from multiple sites on the premises of the plant were sampled. In addition, an environmental risk assessment of operation and control measures implemented at the plant was conducted. Microbiological investigation was conducted to identify Legionella bacteria from environmental samples and clinical isolates. Diagnostic tests at local hospitals included urinary antigen tests for Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 (Lp-1), culture, and indirect immunofluorescence tests for serum antibody against Legionella pneumophila. Legionella bacteria were isolated from environmental samples using standard methods and were identified to the species and serogroup level using direct immunofluorescence and random amplified polymorphic DNA polymerase chain reaction methods. All clinical and environmental isolates of Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 were analyzed using the pulsed-field gel electrophoresis\\u2013SfiI method to determine if they were genetically related. A Gaussian dispersion model (ADMS 3) was used to simulate the dispersion of presumably infectious aerosols from the cooling towers of plant A. The flat topography of the area allowed the model to simulate the aerosol dispersion on a horizontal scale over the epidemic zone on the basis of the following parameters: the emission parameters of plant A (including CT configuration, capacity, mode of function, and cleaning operations), and hourly meteorological data during the corresponding period (temperature, humidity, nebulosity, and wind speed and direction). Geographical information systems analysis was performed in ArcMap (version 8.3; ESRI) to identify potential sources of Legionella bacteria contamination and to assess the spatial distribution and temporal trends of Legionella bacteria",

            "In late May, 2007, a massive cyanobacterial bloom occurred in Lake Taihu, China, which is the sole water supply for approximately two million people in Wuxi City. The bloom was caused by excessive nutrient enrichment and was made worse by an unusually warm spring, which caused the prevailing wind direction during this period to cause the bloom to accumulate at the shoreline near the intake of the water plant. Water was diverted from the nearby Yangtze River in an effort to flush the lake of the bloom. However, this management action was counterproductive, because it produced a current which transported the bloom into the intake, exacerbating the drinking water contamination problem. The severity of this microcystin toxin containing bloom and the ensuing drinking water crisis were attributable to excessive nutrient enrichment; however, a multi-annual warming trend extended the bloom period and amplified its severity, and this was made worse by unanticipated negative impacts of water management.

This value can be calculated by dividing the number of individuals who became ill by the total number of individuals who were exposed to the contaminated water. For example, if 100 individuals became ill after being exposed to contaminated water, and if the total number of individuals who were exposed to the contaminated water was 1000, then the attack rate would be 10% (100/1000). It is important to note that the attack rate is only an estimate, and that it can vary depending on the specific circumstances of the contaminated water event. Additionally, it is important to note that the attack rate is only one measure of the health impact of contaminated water. Other measures, such as the incidence rate and the prevalence rate, may also be useful in assessing the health impact of contaminated water.",

Concentrations of chemical oxygen demand (CODMn), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP) and chlorophyll a (Chl-a) of these samples ranged from 7.7 to 53.6 mgL-1, 4.7 to 23.4 mgL-1, 0.23 to 1.05 mgL-1 and 78.3 to 978.5\\u00b5gL-1, respectively. These values were up to 10 times the values normally observed in Taihu. On June 3, 2007, spatial distributions of CODMn, TN and TP concentration in Gonghu Bay were examined. Peak concentrations of CODMn, TN and TP were 13.1 mg L-1, 10.6 mg L-1 and 0.54 mg L-1 respectively, about 3-5 times the average concentrations for that time of the year in Taihu. Spatial distribution analyses showed that the highest CODMn, TN and TP concentrations were to the northeast of the water intake. This suggested that the bloom originated from the northeast part of Gonghu Bay. Chemical analysis of agglomerates sampled on June 4, 2007 showed that peak concentrations of the odor producing compounds dimethyl trisulfide and alkyl sulfide were 11 and 399 ng L-1 respectively (Yang and others 2008). This concentration was more than enough to generate the strong odor that was observed (Yang and others 2008). The additional cyanobacterial odor generating metabolites, 2-methyl-iso-borneol and geosmin, were also detected in the agglomerates (Yang and others 2008).

            "The investigation identified several risk factors contributing to the drinking water contamination event. These risk factors include:\n1. Eutrophication and excessive nutrient enrichment of the lake water, which led to the massive cyanobacterial bloom event.\n2. Unusually warm spring temperatures, which accelerated the growth and development of the cyanobacterial bloom.\n3. Prevailing wind direction during the bloom event, which caused the bloom to accumulate at the shoreline near the intake of the water plant.\n4. Lack of effective monitoring and early warning systems for cyanobacterial blooms and their potential impacts on drinking water supplies.\n5. Limited understanding and awareness of the risks and potential health impacts associated with exposure to cyanobacterial toxins, including microcystins, in drinking water supplies.\n6.

However, it is important to note that this event duration is based on the available information at the time and may not be complete or accurate. Further investigation and research may be necessary to fully understand the duration and extent of this contamination event.",

To address this issue, alternative management strategies were explored, such as using ultrasonic technology to break up the bloom and prevent it from accumulating at the shoreline near the intake. Additionally, efforts were made to reduce nutrient enrichment in the lake by implementing stricter regulations on agricultural runoff and industrial wastewater discharge into the lake.

The investigation by boat around the water intake found a decomposed cyanobacterial scum, i.e. foam-covered black agglomerates, flowing slowly towards the intake of the water works.

The outbreak affected a total of 709 individuals, with symptoms including fever, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. No fatal cases were reported, but 18 cases were hospitalized for treatment. The cause of the outbreak was later determined to be waterborne transmission from a contaminated well supplying water to approximately 40% of the town's population. The well, identified as Drosero well, was found to have a high bacterial load, with water specimens revealing the presence of E. coli, Enterococcus, Clostridium, and Pseudomonas spp. The bacteriological cultures of stool specimens collected from the first eight patients confirmed the presence of enteropathogenic viruses, including Norovirus. The detection of Norovirus in both water and stool specimens provided strong evidence supporting the waterborne transmission of the outbreak. The detection of Norovirus in stool specimens also confirmed the diagnosis of acute gastroenteritis in the affected individuals. The detection of Norovirus in both water and stool specimens also provided important information for public health officials to take appropriate measures to prevent further spread of the outbreak and to protect the health of the affected population. The detection of Norovirus in both water and stool specimens also provided important information for researchers to better understand the epidemiology and transmission dynamics of Norovirus and other enteric viruses. The detection of Norovirus in both water and stool specimens also highlighted the importance of implementing effective water treatment and distribution systems to prevent waterborne outbreaks and to protect public health. The detection of Norovirus in both water and stool specimens also underscored the importance of promoting good hygiene practices, such as frequent handwashing with soap and water, especially after using the toilet or before handling food, and avoiding close contact with sick individuals.

In this case, six patients became ill out of an estimated total number of individuals exposed to the contaminated water during the outbreak (the exact number is not provided in the context). Therefore, the attack rate is calculated as follows: attack rate = (number of individuals who became ill) / (total number of individuals who were exposed) = 6/X where X is the total number of individuals who were exposed during the outbreak. Unfortunately, the exact number is not provided in the context. Therefore, we cannot calculate the exact attack rate in this case. However, we can calculate an approximate attack rate based on the available information. To do this, we can assume that all six patients were the only individuals who were exposed to the contaminated water during the outbreak (this is an extreme assumption and it is unlikely that this was the case in reality). Under this assumption, the total number of individuals who were exposed during the outbreak would be equal to six (the number of patients who became ill). Therefore, the approximate attack rate under this extreme assumption would be as follows: attack rate = (number of individuals who became ill) / (total number of individuals who were exposed) = 6/6 = 1 or 100% (this is an extreme and unlikely scenario). However, it is important to note that this extreme assumption is unlikely to be true in reality. Therefore, the approximate attack rate based on this extreme assumption should be interpreted with caution and should not be considered as an accurate representation of the true attack rate in this case. To obtain a more accurate estimate of the attack rate, it would be necessary to obtain more detailed and accurate information about the number of individuals who were exposed to the contaminated water during the outbreak and the number of individuals who became ill as a result of this exposure.

A total of 1300 laboratory-confirmed cases were reported, with an estimated 2500 cases treated for giardiasis probably linked to the outbreak. The risk of infection for persons receiving water from the water supply serving Bergen city centre was significantly higher than for those receiving water from other supplies.

Water samples were collected from different locations in the water source and from several small streams that went into the lake. On the 7th and 11th of November, seven parallel samples were taken and investigated for presence of giardia cysts at the Norwegian Veterinary School and the Swedish Institute for Infectious Disease Control. Of the first 795 cases registered by December 1st, 637 cases (80%) lived in the central part of the city, served by water supply A. During the months August to November, a total of 42,774 people received water from supply A. This yielded an attack rate in this supply zone of 149/10,000, compared to 8/10,000 in the other supply zones combined; RR 18 (95% CI: 15 \\u2013 22) (Table 1 and Figure 3). Inspection of the sewage system in the nearby residential area found that the sewage pipes were old with signs of leakage. In times with heavy rainfall, overflow of the pipes would lead to leakage into the lake serving water supply A. Based on the epidemiological findings together with results of water samples taken from treated water on November 3rd, a boil water notice was issued on November 5th to persons receiving drinking water from water supply A. Specific instructions were also issued to hotels, restaurants, other retail food outlets and institutions regarding water use and preventive measures. At the same time the waterworks redirected water from other water supplies, so the area receiving water from water supply A was restricted (Figure 3). From November 5th to November 18th, the number of persons receiving water from water supply A was thus reduced from 25,000 to 6,700. A comprehensive mapping system available on the municipality's website was used to inform the public in the affected area about when they could start drinking tap water at their home address. The entire distribution system in the centre of Bergen was flushed in order to remove any remaining Giardia cysts. To stop further contamination, public and private sewage pipes in residential areas and tourist facilities located nearby the water source were checked and improved if needed. On December 21st, 2004 the boiling advice was lifted. This was decided because all recent water samples were negative for Giardia cysts, and all the identified contamination sources had been eliminated. However, the public was strongly advised to maintain a high level of personal hygiene. There was a special awareness on possible secondary transmission in child care institutions and swimming pools. A water treatment plant with filtration and UV disinfection had already been commissioned for the affected water supply before the outbreak, with planned start of operation in 2007. In the interim period, a temporary UV plant was opened in February 2005 to provide additional disinfection for the water supply while the new treatment plant is being built.",

The contaminated water was found to have elevated total coliform and Escherichia coli counts. The consumption of contaminated water from these fountains led to a multi-pathogen outbreak, with confirmed cases of Shigella sonnei infection, astrovirus infection, norovirus infection, astrovirus and rotavirus infection, and astrovirus and norovirus infection. Residents are advised to stop drinking water from these fountains and to use clean water from the water treatment plant instead. The fountains should be cleaned and disinfected before being reconnected to the water supply.",

            "The contamination event was first discovered during an investigation into a gastroenteritis outbreak in Erzurum city, Turkey in December 2012. During the investigation, it was found that many of the probable cases had only consumed water from antique neighbourhood fountains in the week before illness onset. Conversely, most controls had only consumed bottled or tap water during that time period. Based on these findings, it was hypothesized that the contamination event may have occurred at the neighbourhood fountains. To test this hypothesis, water samples were collected from the fountains for bacterial culture and real-time multiplex PCR analysis to identify any pathogens that may be present in the water. The results of these analyses confirmed that the water samples from the neighbourhood fountains were contaminated with elevated total coliform and Escherichia coli counts, indicating the presence of faecal contamination in the water. These findings provided strong evidence that the contamination event at the neighbourhood fountains was the likely source of the gastroenteritis outbreak in Erzurum city during December 2012.",

However, it is important to note that only 72% of cases and 15% of controls only drank water from antique neighbourhood fountains during the week before illness onset. The other 28% of cases and 85% of controls only drank bottled or tap water. Therefore, it is likely that only those who only drank water from antique neighbourhood fountains during the week before illness onset were actually affected by the contaminated fountain water. The exact number of people who fell ill due to the contaminated fountain water is not explicitly stated in the provided text. However, based on the information provided, it is reasonable to assume that only those who only drank water from antique neighbourhood fountains during the week before illness onset were actually affected by the contaminated fountain water. Therefore, the number of people who fell ill due to the contaminated fountain water is likely to be much smaller than the total number of cases and controls identified in the study.",

In this context, the attack rate for the Shigella sonnei outbreak would be calculated as the number of individuals who became ill with Shigella sonnei divided by the total number of individuals who were exposed to Shigella sonnei from the contaminated fountain water. Similarly, the attack rate for the astrovirus, norovirus, and rotavirus outbreaks would be calculated in a similar manner using the number of individuals who became ill with each respective pathogen divided by the total number of individuals who were exposed to each respective pathogen from the contaminated fountain water.",

While it is not explicitly stated that all of these individuals were exposed to the contaminant from the municipal water supply, it is a reasonable assumption based on the information provided. Therefore, it is likely that several hundred individuals were exposed to the contaminant from the municipal water supply. However, it is important to note that this is an estimate based on the available information, and the actual number of individuals exposed could be higher or lower.",
            "The number of people who fell ill due to the event was 2700.",
            "The attack rate is the ratio of individuals who became ill to those who were exposed. In this case, the attack rate for C. jejuni infection was calculated by dividing the number of ill persons (45) by the total number of persons who were exposed and contacted the health centre (442). Therefore, the attack rate for C. jejuni infection was approximately 10.2% (45/442).",
            "Based on the provided data, no fatalities were reported among the 442 persons with gastroenteritis who contacted the health centre.",
            "C. jejuni was isolated from 45 (61%) of the 74 stool samples tested. All strains were susceptible to erythromycin and ciprofloxacin. All five strains analysed further by PFGE showed an indistinguishable PFGE pattern (Fig. 1). No other pathogens were detected in patient samples.",
            "The symptoms associated with the contamination were diarrhoea (three or more stools during 24 h) or at least two of the following symptoms: fever, abdominal pain, vomiting, nausea; and illness onset from 1 to 20 August.",

Chlorination of water began on 13 August. Cases were defined as residents of Municipality A with diarrhoea or at least two of the following symptoms: fever, abdominal pain, vomiting, nausea; and illness onset from 1 to 20 August. The questionnaire was mailed on 26 August to persons who reported new joint or musculoskeletal symptoms after gastroenteritis in the population survey (n=101) and to persons who contacted the municipal health centre because of new joint or musculoskeletal symptoms after gastroenteritis from 1 August to 15 September 1998 (n=13). Participants were asked about onset and duration of musculoskeletal symptoms, which joints were affected, use of health services and treatment for musculoskeletal symptoms. Probable reactive arthritis was defined as a new joint symptom, including arthralgia, redness, and/or swelling in one or more joints within 1 month of gastroenteritis [18]. Laboratory investigation of patients: Stool specimens were collected from 74 patients who had gastrointestinal symptoms. Twenty-six (35%) specimens were analysed for the presence of Salmonella, Shigella, Yersinia, Campylobacter, Aeromonas and Plesiomonas spp. as well as Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus and Clostridium perfringens. The remaining 48 (65%) specimens were cultured for Campylobacter sp. only. For campylobacters, water samples of 350\\u20134000 ml volume were filtered through membranes with 0.45 mm pore size and the filters were enriched in Bolton enrichment broth at 37 xC for 24 and 48 h in a microaerobic atmosphere and cultured [22]. Environmental investigation: The municipal water supply was inspected on 12 and 27 August by local authorities in collaboration with the Department of Environmental Health and the Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology of KTL. Water samples were collected from groundwater wells, a water reservoir and households for microbiological investigation. The first sample collected on 8 August was investigated for coliforms. Subsequent samples of municipal water were collected on 11\\u201313 August and tested for coliforms and campylobacters. Samples taken on 12 August were also investigated for the presence of noroviruses and parasites. In addition, 100-g samples taken from different parts of the filter material used to reduce the iron content of ground water were studied for campylobacters by enrichment and coliforms. The water samples were studied for coliforms on LES Endo medium. The filter material was studied at a dilution of 10x1 on Violet Red bile agar (VRB). For campylobacters, water samples of 350\\u20134000 ml volume were filtered through membranes with 0.45 mm pore size and the filters were enriched in Bolton enrichment broth at 37 xC for 24 and 48 h in a microaerobic atmosphere and cultured [22].",

            "During the investigation, several risk factors were identified as potential sources of contamination or contributing factors to the outbreak. These risk factors included:\n\n1. Consumption of untreated groundwater: During the investigation, it was found that some residents of Municipality A were consuming untreated groundwater from private wells instead of using the municipal water supply. This practice was identified as a potential risk factor for the outbreak as untreated groundwater can harbor various pathogens including Campylobacter jejuni.\n2. Consumption of raw or undercooked poultry: During the investigation, it was found that some residents of Municipality A had consumed raw or undercooked poultry during the incubation period of the outbreak. This practice was identified as a potential risk factor for the outbreak as raw or undercooked poultry can harbor various pathogens including Campylobacter jejuni.\n3. Consumption of contaminated food or water during mass catering events or travel: During the investigation, it was found that some residents of Municipality A had traveled to other regions or had attended mass catering events during the incubation period of the outbreak. It was also found that some of these events or travel destinations had been associated with outbreaks of gastrointestinal illness caused by Campylobacter jejuni or other pathogens in the past. This finding was identified as a potential risk factor for the outbreak as contaminated food or water during mass catering events or travel can harbor various pathogens including Campylobacter jejuni.\n4. Poor personal hygiene practices: During the investigation, it was found that some residents of Municipality A had reported poor personal hygiene practices during the incubation period of the outbreak. This finding was identified as a potential risk factor for the outbreak as poor personal hygiene practices can facilitate the transmission of various pathogens including Campylobacter jejuni.\n5. Contact with infected animals or their environments: During the investigation, it was found that some residents of Municipality A had reported contact with infected animals or their environments during the incubation period of the outbreak. This finding was identified as a potential risk factor for the outbreak as contact with infected animals or their environments can facilitate the transmission of various pathogens including Campylobacter jejuni.\n6. Consumption of contaminated food or water from other sources: During the investigation, it was found that some residents of Municipality A had reported consuming contaminated food or water from other sources during the incubation period of the outbreak. This finding was identified as a potential risk factor for the outbreak as contaminated food or water from other sources can harbor various pathogens including Campylobacter jejuni.\n\nOverall, these risk factors were identified as potential sources of contamination or contributing factors to the outbreak of gastrointestinal illness caused by Campylobacter jejuni in Municipality A during the summer of 1998. Further investigation and confirmation of these risk factors were carried out through laboratory testing and epidemiological analysis.",

Repair of mains: Based on the investigation findings, it was determined that mains repair was the likely source of contamination. Therefore, repairs have been carried out on the mains system to prevent any future contamination events.\n3. Public education and awareness: Public education and awareness campaigns have been launched to inform residents about the importance of maintaining good hygiene practices and avoiding drinking non-chlorinated groundwater during outbreaks or suspected contamination events. These campaigns have been carried out through various channels, including local media, community centers, and schools.",

            "The contamination event occurred when heavy rainfall caused drainage of sheep feces into a shallow aquifer, leading to contamination of the untreated reticulated water supply in Havelock North, New Zealand. The event resulted in an estimated 6260-8320 cases of illness, including up to 2230 cases outside the reticulation area, and 953 confirmed cases. The event also resulted in four deaths and four confirmed cases of Guillain-Barr\\u00e9 syndrome. The event highlighted the importance of having robust clinical surveillance systems in place to facilitate early detection and response to such events. Additionally, the event underscored the need for ongoing investment in water infrastructure and source protection measures to prevent such events from occurring in the future.",

However, it can be inferred that the exposure likely occurred through consumption of contaminated water from the Havelock North reticulated water system between 5 and 12 August 2016. The contamination likely occurred following heavy rainfall on 5-6 August 2016, which caused drainage of sheep feces into a shallow aquifer. The existence of a routine clinical surveillance system for campylobacteriosis facilitated identification of the outbreak, recovery of clinical isolates, and early testing of the water for pathogens. Genotyping of the Campylobacter jejuni helped define the source of the outbreak and confirm outbreak periods and cases. Based on these findings, it can be estimated that between 6260 and 8320 individuals were exposed to the contaminant during the outbreak period. However, it is important to note that this estimate is based on several assumptions and may not be entirely accurate.",
            "The number of people who fell ill due to the event is estimated between 6260 and 8320 cases. Of these, 953 cases were physician reported, 42 were hospitalized, three developed Guillain-Barr\\u00e9syndrome, and Campylobacter infection contributed to at least four deaths. Of the 12 genotypes observed in cases, four were also observed in water, three were also observed in sheep and one was also observed in both water and sheep.",
            "The attack rate is the ratio of individuals who became ill to those who were exposed. In this context, it would represent the proportion of individuals who were exposed to the contaminated water and went on to develop campylobacteriosis. To estimate this proportion, data on the number of individuals who were exposed to the contaminated water and the number who developed campylobacteriosis would be required. These data could be obtained through surveillance activities, such as active case finding and laboratory testing, as well as through passive surveillance systems, such as hospital records and notification data from public health agencies. Once these data have been collected and analyzed, the attack rate can be calculated as the proportion of individuals who were exposed to the contaminated water and developed campylobacteriosis. This proportion can provide valuable insights into the magnitude and impact of the outbreak, as well as into the effectiveness of various control measures that were implemented in response to the outbreak.",

Routine microbiological testing from the Havelock North reticulated water supply taken on 11 August was positive for E. coli . Heavy rainfall of 6 \to5 inches (165 mm) during 5-6 August was suspected to have contributed to the contamination of the water supply. The water supplier (Hastings District Council) responded the same day by issuing a 'boil water notice' and initiating chlorination of the Havelock North reticulated water supply. A probable campylobacteriosis case was defined as an individual who consumed Havelock North reticulated water between 5 and 12 August who developed diarrheal disease during 7 and 22 August. Results were age-adjusted to the population of Havelock North.",
            "The investigation involved several steps. First, clinicians were encouraged to collect fecal specimens from probable cases to identify pathogens contributing to the outbreak. Once Campylobacter spp. were identified as the likely etiologic pathogen, routine surveillance was modified. Sentinel surveillance in two primary care practices serving Havelock North and adjacent areas replaced the usual testing practices for gastroenteritis cases. Fecal specimens were collected from the first seven patients meeting the case definition twice weekly during 17 August to 9 September 2016. To estimate the proportion of households and residents affected by the outbreak, a cross-sectional study of Havelock North residents was also conducted by randomly surveying 660 households supplied by the Havelock North reticulated water system (conducted as three rounds of telephone surveys using the same panel of households, with the last survey on the 22 August). A case was defined as a resident of Havelock North with exposure to the Have- lock North reticulated water supply during 5-12 August who developed diarrheal disease during 7-22 August. Results were age- adjusted to the population of Havelock North. Testing of four Havelock North reticulated water samples, and the bores sampled on 12 August found total coliforms of 30-110 MPN/100 mL and E. coli of 10-23 MPN/100 mL. All four reticulated water samples and one of the bore water samples were positive for C. jejuni. Following chlorination of the water supply on the 12 August, free available chlorine levels of 1 ppm were confirmed on 13 August. C. jejuni were isolated from 12 of 16 sheep fecal samples collected from paddocks adjacent to the bores. Reported rates of campylobacteriosis are typically higher in males, in those aged between 20 and 29, and children less than 5 years of age. In this outbreak, reported rates did not show this pattern, perhaps reflecting the indiscriminate nature of drinking water exposure. Rates were disproportionately high among those aged over 60, which we attribute to underlying susceptibility in this age group , and the use of active case finding targeted to older residents.",

Genotyping of the Campylobacter jejuni helped define the source of the outbreak and confirm outbreak periods and cases. However, it is important to note that poor farm management practices, such as inadequate manure storage and application, and failure to maintain adequate separation distances between livestock and water sources, can contribute to the contamination of drinking water sources with Campylobacter jejuni and other pathogens. Therefore, it is essential that farmers and other stakeholders implement effective farm management practices to minimize the risk of contamination of drinking water sources with Campylobacter jejuni and other pathogens.",

            "The reported rates of campylobacteriosis in this outbreak did not show the typical pattern of higher rates in males, those aged between 20 and 29, and children less than 5 years of age. Instead, rates were disproportionately high among those aged over 60. This age group is known to be more susceptible to campylobacteriosis due to underlying health conditions and weaker immune systems. Additionally, active case finding targeted to older residents may have contributed to the higher reported rates in this age group."

The water from the river is in contact with the walls of the cement reservoir tank in which water from the source is gathered.\n\n3. Several animal breeding farms and houses are located in the basin of the river, and it is possible that the contamination may have originated from these sources as well.\n\n4. The water from the source is transferred to a tank in the city, where chlorination takes place before distribution. Self-assessment microbiological tests are conducted by the municipality water authority on a monthly basis according to national legislation.\n\n5. Almost half of the houses in Elassona are served by the public water supply system. Cases originated from houses with public or private systems. The public water supply system was inspected on 16 March by the Regional Public Health Laboratory of Thessaly. Water samples were collected on 6 April and 11 April after heavy rainfall for microbiological and chemical analysis. A case-control study with a 1:2 ratio was designed. The study population was restricted to the residents of Elassona. A probable gastroenteritis case was defined as any resident of Elassona that presented acute diarrhoea (three or more episodes) or vomiting and one or more episodes of loose stools in a 24-hour period between 6 and 17 March. A confirmed case was defined as a probable case that was laboratory confirmed. Between 6 March and 1 April 2012, 552 cases were recorded at Elassona HCC. Of these, 341 were residents of Elassona [attack rate 341/7233=4.7%], 53 were residents of adjacent villages with the same water supply system [attack rate 53/1337=4\\u00b70%], and 158 were from villages with a different water supply system [attack rate 158/28 694=0\\u00b76%].",
            "The contamination event was first discovered when medical doctors of Elassona HCC reported an unusual increase of gastroenteritis cases since 10 March.",
            "The number of individuals exposed to the contaminant is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the exposure likely occurred through the consumption of contaminated water. The context indicates that there were increased numbers of gastroenteritis cases in Elassona district between 6 and 17 March. It is also mentioned that water samples were collected from the source, the tank and tap water and placed a filter at the source for Cryptosporidium detection. These facts suggest that there may have been a waterborne outbreak of gastroenteritis in Elassona district during the specified time period. Therefore, it can be assumed that a large number of individuals were likely exposed to the contaminant through the consumption of contaminated water during the outbreak. However, it should be noted that this is an assumption based on the available context and that the exact number of individuals exposed to the contaminant is not explicitly stated in the provided context.",

            "The microbiological analysis of water samples collected from the source, the tank and tap water revealed the presence of Cryptosporidium oocysts and Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria in all samples. The chemical analysis confirmed that the water samples met the national standards for drinking water. The presence of Cryptosporidium oocysts and E. coli bacteria in all water samples collected from the source, the tank and tap water strongly suggests that these pathogens were present in the water supply system and were responsible for the outbreak of gastroenteritis in Elassona.",
            "The symptoms associated with the contamination were acute diarrhoea (three or more episodes) or vomiting and one or more episodes of loose stools in a 24-h period between 6 and 17 March.",
            "The initial actions taken to investigate or inspect the event were not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that health inspectors from RPHL of Thessaly collected six water samples from the source, the tank and tap water for microbiological and chemical analysis on 16 March. Additionally, almost half of the houses in Elassona were visited and the total number of people living in each house and the number of persons that had developed gastroenteritis were recorded and the attack rate was estimated on more than 200 houses distributed throughout the region. Finally, information on absence from schools of Elassona and Tsaritsani was collected. It should be noted that by the time the outbreak was notified, pre-schools/nurseries had already been closed because of the increased number of ill children. This is actually indicative of the high attack rate in toddlers.",

A confirmed case is defined as a probable case that is laboratory confirmed.",
            "The investigation identified several risk factors for acquiring infection during the waterborne outbreak. These risk factors included:\n1. Consumption of tap water: A case-control study showed that consumption of tap water was a risk factor for acquiring infection during the outbreak [odds ratio (OR) 2.18, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.11-4.18]].\n2. Lack of awareness and education about waterborne diseases and their prevention: The investigation found that many residents of Elassona were unaware of the risks associated with consuming contaminated water and how to prevent waterborne diseases. This lack of awareness and education about waterborne diseases and their prevention contributed to the spread of infection during the outbreak.\n3. Poor water quality and inadequate water treatment and disinfection: The investigation found that the water source and ice cubes from a local production enterprise were contaminated with bacterial indicators of recent faecal contamination. This contamination contributed to the spread of infection during the outbreak. The investigation also found that the public water supply system was insufficiently treated and disinfected, which may have contributed to the contamination of the water source and ice cubes during the outbreak.\n4. Heavy rainfall and flooding: The investigation found that heavy rainfall and flooding occurred in the region during the week before the onset of the gastroenteritis cases. Several patients had reported that the water during this period was coloured. This heavy rainfall and flooding may have contributed to the contamination of the water source and ice cubes during the outbreak by washing faecal matter into the water supply system.\n5. Poor hygiene practices and inadequate hand washing facilities: The investigation found that several residents of Elassona had poor hygiene practices and did not wash their hands properly and frequently enough, especially after using the toilet or before handling food. This lack of hand washing and poor hygiene practices may have contributed to the spread of infection during the outbreak by allowing faecal matter to come into contact with food or water and be ingested by other individuals. Additionally, the investigation found that there were inadequate hand washing facilities available in some public places and schools in Elassona, which may have contributed to the poor hand washing practices observed during the investigation and the subsequent spread of infection during the outbreak.",

The local public health authorities were requested to provide information on the number and demographic characteristics of gastroenteritis cases treated at Elassona Health Care Centre (HCC) since 1 March.\n3. The HCDCP decided to further investigate the outbreak in collaboration with the local public health authorities and laboratories with different expertise.\n4. The objectives of the investigation were the identification of the mode and vehicle of transmission, as well as of possible risk factors, in order to implement appropriate control measures.\n5. An active case-finding was initiated and medical doctors of Elassona HCC were requested to provide the total number of gastroenteritis cases they had treated since 1 March and their demographic characteristics.\n6.

            "The exact date of the contamination event is unknown. However, it is known that tap water consumption was associated with illness onset from 1 to 14 May 2007. The investigation identified several events that might have caused pressure fall and influx of contaminated water into the water distribution system. These events included two occasions of pressure fall and parts of the distribution system that were outdated. However, it is important to note that no single event was identified as the cause of contamination.",
            "The exact location of the contamination event is not known. However, it is believed that the contamination occurred somewhere within the water distribution system of R\\u00f8ros.",
            "During the outbreak, it was identified that untreated tap water from a groundwater source was suspected as the vehicle of infection. The outbreak started on 7 May 2007 when the municipal medical officer reported 10 cases of gastroenteritis among residents of R\\u00f8ros. The estimated number of cases rose to a few hundreds in the three following days. The waterworks personnel took additional samples from different locations in the water distribution system and identified Campylobacter as the causative agent of the outbreak. The investigation confirmed a waterborne outbreak of campylobacteriosis in R\\u00f8ros. Although no single event was identified as the cause of contamination, this outbreak illustrates the vulnerability of water distribution systems. Good quality source water alone is not enough to ensure water safety. For a better risk management, more focus should be put on the distribution system security. Waterworks personnel should monitor the pressure regularly; reduce the leakage by upgrading the distribution network and use chlorination when conducting maintenance work.",
            "The text does not provide enough information to determine what triggered the contamination event.",
            "The investigation identified several events and conditions that might have contributed to the contamination of the water distribution system in R\\u00f8ros. These included:\n1. Pressure fall and influx of contaminated water into the distribution system. This was observed on two occasions and was attributed to outdated parts of the distribution system and pressure fall due to increased water demand during peak hours.\n2. Leakage and poor maintenance of the distribution system. This was identified as a significant contributing factor to the contamination of the water distribution system in R\\u00f8ros. The investigation found that the distribution system was outdated and poorly maintained, with many leaks and inadequate chlorination. These conditions allowed contaminated water to enter the distribution system and spread throughout the community.\n3. Untreated groundwater source and inadequate water treatment processes. The investigation found that the groundwater source used by the R\\u00f8ros waterworks was untreated and contained high levels of naturally occurring contaminants, such as iron, manganese and sulphate. These contaminants can negatively impact water quality and make it more susceptible to contamination by pathogens and other harmful substances.\nThe investigation also found that the water treatment processes used by the R\\u00f8ros waterworks were inadequate and failed to effectively remove contaminants and pathogens from the water supply. This allowed contaminated water to enter the distribution system and spread throughout the community.\n4. Human error and inadequate training of waterworks personnel. The investigation found that human error and inadequate training of waterworks personnel were significant contributing factors to the contamination of the water distribution system in R\\u00f8ros. The investigation found that waterworks personnel failed to properly maintain and monitor the water distribution system, allowing contaminated water to enter and spread throughout the community. The investigation also found that waterworks personnel were not adequately trained to properly maintain and monitor the water distribution system, allowing contaminated water to enter and spread throughout the community.\n\nIn conclusion, the investigation identified several events and conditions that might have contributed to the contamination of the water distribution system in R\\u00f8ros. These included pressure fall and influx of contaminated water into the distribution system, leakage and poor maintenance of the distribution system, untreated groundwater source and inadequate water treatment processes, and human error and inadequate training of waterworks personnel. These conditions allowed contaminated water to enter and spread throughout the community, resulting in a waterborne outbreak of campylobacteriosis in R\\u00f8ros.",
            "The contamination event was first discovered when the municipal medical officer in R\\u00f8ros received reports of diarrhoea and other gastrointestinal symptoms among residents and employees of the town and its neighbouring municipality Holt\\u00e5len. The estimated number of cases rose to a few hundreds in the three following days, and tap water was suspected to be the vehicle of infection. Five patients' stool samples were collected and tested positive for Campylobacter spp. A case was defined as a person living in R\\u00f8ros or Holt\\u00e5len municipality with diarrhoea (passing three or more loose stools in one day) or experiencing at least two of the following symptoms of acute gastroenteritis lasting at least two days: nausea, vomiting, stomach cramps or pain, flatulence, fever, headache and blood in the stool. We excluded those who recently travelled abroad, those with unknown date of gastroenteritis symptoms onset and those whose illness started before 1 May 2007 from the analysis. To rapidly assess the attack rate in the different supply zones (RH and RL), we phoned and asked 11 institutions (six kindergartens and five nursing homes) about the occurrence of gastroenteritis among the employees or children/residents. We assumed children and residents in the institutions to be less mobile and therefore more likely to be exposed to tap water from only one of the two supply zones. Stool samples were collected from some of the symptomatic patients at R\\u00f8ros and Holt\\u00e5len municipal health centres. Culture and biochemical identification of bacterial enteropathogens were done according to standard microbiological methods at St. Olavs Hospital in Trondheim [14,15]. The specimens were cultured for Salmonella, Shigella and Yersinia. The specimens were further cultured \n\n  for Campylobacter on charcoal cefoperazone desoxycholate agar (Mast Diagnostics, Merseyside, UK) in a microaerophilic atmosphere at 42\\u00b0C for two days. Typical colonies including oxidase positive, hippurate positive, motile short rods were identified as Campylobacter jejuni. The Campylobacter isolates were sent to \n\n  the NIPH for genotyping using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP)[16,17]. The samples were also tested for adenovirus, rotavirus, norovirus, astrovirus, Giardia lamblia and Clostridium difficile toxin A/B using enzyme immuno assay or polymerase chain reaction [18,19]. Microscopy for Cryptosporidium oocysts and Giardia cysts on previously frozen samples was done at the Norwegian School of Veterinary Science. Waterworks personnel take weekly routine water samples from seven different locations in R\\u00f8ros according to their risk assessment strategy. Weekly samples are tested for total bacterial count, coliform bacteria, turbidity and colour. Quarterly samples are additionally tested for intestinal enterococci, pH and conductivity. All tests are performed according to the standard methods described in the national legislation for waterworks [20]. During the outbreak, the waterworks personnel took additional samples from different locations in the water distribution system. Samples taken on 11 May were additionally tested for Campylobacter according to the national standard method (NS-ISO 17995). The local Food Safety Authority and the waterworks personnel thoroughly inspected the R\\u00f8ros waterworks, including the wells, the reservoirs and the distribution system.

The isolates were sent to the Norwegian Institute of Public Health for genotyping. The AFLP analysis showed that all Campylobacter isolates from patients and environmental samples were identical at the genetic level. This finding provided strong evidence that the outbreak was caused by a single source of contamination. The investigation also identified several potential sources of contamination, including untreated tap water from a groundwater source and outdated parts of the distribution system. However, no definitive evidence was found to link any of these sources to the outbreak. The investigation concluded that the most likely explanation for the outbreak was contamination of the water distribution system with Campylobacter jejuni from a single source.

As a result, finished water leaving the surface water treatment plants contained high levels of fecal coliform bacteria, averaging 163 cfu/100 mL. Water samples taken from household and community taps throughout the city contained even higher levels of fecal coliform bacteria, averaging 175 cfu/100 mL (range, 0 to 1400).

It is also known that water leaving the surface water treatment plants contained high levels of fecal coliform bacteria, and that water at the wellheads at the two groundwater plants contained no fecal coliform bacteria. However, it is not known for certain whether the contamination originated from the surface water treatment plants, the groundwater sources, or some other source within or outside the city. Further investigation would be needed to determine the exact source of the contamination.",
            "The contamination event was first discovered when a large outbreak of typhoid fever occurred in Dushanbe in 1997. The cause of the outbreak was traced back to contaminated drinking water. Detailed investigations revealed that the contamination event was likely caused by a failure in the water treatment and distribution system, allowing contaminated water to enter the system and mix with treated water. The failure in the water treatment and distribution system was likely due to a combination of factors, including inadequate funding for water treatment and infrastructure maintenance, lack of skilled personnel to operate and maintain water treatment plants and distribution systems, and poor water quality in the source water used for treatment, which increased the demand for chlorine as a disinfectant in the water treatment process. The failure in the water treatment and distribution system was further compounded by the closure of the chlorine-producing facility in Yavan, Tajikistan, which once supplied chlorine to Tajikistan and several other Central Asian countries. The site visit revealed no salvageable equipment at the chlorine-producing facility in Yavan. The lack of chlorine availability at the treatment plants from December 1996 to the beginning of April 1997 further exacerbated the contamination event in the water treatment and distribution system. The failure in the water treatment and distribution system was further compounded by the western portion of the city receiving unfiltered surface water through a siphon from the main sedimentation basin at one of the treatment plants, and the catchment area for clinic 11 receiving a mixture of spring water and unfiltered, unchlorinated river water.

            "The attack rate is the ratio of individuals who became ill to those who were exposed. In this context, it refers to the proportion of individuals who developed typhoid fever out of those who were exposed to the contaminated water source. The attack rate is an important measure in epidemiology for assessing the impact and severity of an infectious disease outbreak. It provides valuable insights into the dynamics of disease transmission and helps inform public health interventions and policy decisions aimed at preventing and controlling future outbreaks.",

            "The symptoms associated with contamination by Salmonella Typhi include fever, headache, abdominal pain, diarrhea or constipation, chills, and loss of appetite [1]. In severe cases, Salmonella Typhi infection can lead to complications such as renal failure, hepatitis, intestinal hemorrhage, or septicemia [2]. The incubation period for Salmonella Typhi infection is typically between 1 and 3 weeks [3]. However, it is important to note that the incubation period can vary widely, from as little as a few hours to as long as several weeks [4]. Additionally, it is worth mentioning that Salmonella Typhi infection can also be asymptomatic or subclinical, meaning that some people may not experience any symptoms at all or may only have mild symptoms that go unnoticed [5]. However, it is important to note that even if someone with Salmonella Typhi infection does not experience any symptoms themselves, they can still spread the infection to others through contaminated food or water [6]. Therefore, it is crucial that proper hygiene practices are followed at all times to prevent the spread of Salmonella Typhi infection or any other foodborne or waterborne illnesses.",

            "During the investigation, several risk factors were identified as contributing to the outbreak of typhoid fever in Dushanbe. These risk factors include:\n1. Lack of adequate water treatment and distribution infrastructure in Dushanbe, which resulted in contaminated water being supplied to households and community taps throughout the city.\n2. Poor sanitation practices in Dushanbe, which included the lack of adequate sewage treatment facilities, the widespread use of unimproved latrines and pit privies, and the lack of proper handwashing facilities in households and public places throughout the city.\n3. The presence of contaminated water sources in Dushanbe, which included unprotected springs, unlined wells, and open drains and canals that were contaminated with sewage and industrial waste.\n4. The consumption of contaminated food and water in Dushanbe, which was facilitated by the lack of proper food handling and preparation practices in households and public places throughout the city, as well as the widespread availability of contaminated water sources in Dushanbe.\n5. The presence of large populations of Typhimurium in Dushanbe, which was facilitated by the lack of proper sewage treatment facilities in the city, as well as the widespread availability of contaminated water sources in Dushanbe.\n6. The lack of proper disease surveillance and response systems in Dushanbe, which made it difficult to identify and respond to outbreaks of typhoid fever and other waterborne diseases in a timely and effective manner.\n7. The lack of proper public health education and awareness campaigns in Dushanbe, which made it difficult for residents to understand the risks associated with contaminated water sources in their city, as well as the importance of practicing proper hygiene and sanitation habits in order to reduce their risk of contracting waterborne diseases like typhoid fever.\n\nThese risk factors were identified during the investigation as contributing to the outbreak of typhoid fever in Dushanbe. Addressing these risk factors will be essential in order to prevent future outbreaks of typhoid fever and other waterborne diseases in Dushanbe and other cities in Tajikistan and Central Asia.",

Boiling water before consumption: The city government advised all residents to boil their drinking water before consumption to kill any bacteria or parasites that may be present.\n2. Chlorination of water at treatment plants: Once chlorine became available again at the treatment plants in mid-April 1997, chlorination was immediately resumed to disinfect the water and eliminate any remaining bacteria or parasites.\n3. Water conservation campaign: To improve water pressure and reduce the risk of back-siphonage, a water conservation campaign was launched in mid-April 1997 to encourage residents to conserve water by fixing leaks, using water-efficient appliances, and practicing water-saving habits such as taking shorter showers and using a broom instead of a hose to clean driveways and sidewalks.\n4. Repair and maintenance of water treatment plants and distribution system: To prevent future contamination incidents, regular maintenance and repair work were carried out at all four water treatment plants and throughout the distribution system to ensure that all equipment was functioning properly and that any potential sources of contamination were identified and addressed in a timely manner.\n5. Public education and awareness campaigns: To ensure that all residents were aware of the risks of contamination and the steps they could take to protect themselves and their families, public education and awareness campaigns were launched in mid-April 1997 to provide residents with accurate and up-to-date information about the contamination incident and the steps being taken to address the situation and prevent future incidents from occurring. These campaigns included the distribution of informational brochures and posters throughout the city, the production and broadcasting of public service announcements (PSAs) on local radio and television stations, and the organization and conduct of community meetings and workshops to provide residents with opportunities to ask questions, voice concerns, and share ideas and suggestions with city officials and other experts and professionals involved in addressing the contamination incident and preventing future incidents from occurring.",

            "The Milwaukee Cryptosporidiosis Outbreak of 1993 was a massive contamination event that affected over 400,000 people in the greater Milwaukee area. The outbreak was caused by the presence of cryptosporidium oocysts in the drinking water supplied by the Milwaukee Water Works (MWW). The contamination event began in late February or early March 1993 and lasted until mid-April 1993. During this period, an estimated 403,000 people were exposed to the contaminated water. Of these people, an estimated 401,000 became ill with cryptosporidiosis, and an estimated 285,000 sought medical care for their illness. The illnesses ranged in severity from mild to severe, and the duration of illness varied from a few days to several weeks. The contamination event resulted in an estimated $92 million in direct medical costs and an estimated $227 million in indirect costs, such as lost productivity and wages. The contamination event also resulted in significant long-term health effects for some individuals, including chronic diarrhea, weight loss, and malnutrition. The contamination event also highlighted the importance of effective water treatment and monitoring systems to prevent similar contamination events from occurring in the future. The contamination event also led to significant improvements in public health and safety policies and practices, including the development and implementation of more stringent water quality standards and regulations, as well as the establishment and implementation of more effective and comprehensive public health and safety surveillance and response systems. The contamination event also led to significant improvements in public awareness and education about the importance of maintaining good personal hygiene practices and taking steps to protect themselves and their families from exposure to contaminated water and other potential health hazards. The contamination event also highlighted the importance of effective communication and collaboration between public health and safety agencies, water utilities and treatment facilities, and other relevant organizations and stakeholders to ensure that appropriate and effective measures are taken to prevent and respond to contamination events and other public health and safety emergencies. The contamination event also underscored the importance of ongoing research and innovation in the fields of public health and safety, water quality and treatment, and other related areas to ensure that new and emerging health hazards and contamination risks are identified and addressed in a timely and effective manner.

The presence of these oocysts was confirmed by modified acid-fast staining and/or by immunofluorescence microscopy using monoclonal antibodies specific for cryptosporidium antigens. No other pathogens were identified in the stool samples from these patients.",
            "The symptoms associated with cryptosporidiosis include watery diarrhea, stomach cramps, dehydration, weight loss, and fever. The incubation period for cryptosporidiosis is typically between 2 and 14 days. However, it is important to note that some people may experience no symptoms at all, or only mild symptoms, even if they are infected with cryptosporidium. This is because the severity and duration of symptoms can vary widely from one person to another, depending on factors such as age, overall health status, and individual immune response. Additionally, it is important to note that cryptosporidiosis can also cause illness in immunocompromised individuals, such as those with HIV/AIDS or undergoing chemotherapy or organ transplantation. In these individuals, cryptosporidiosis can cause more severe and prolonged symptoms, and can also increase the risk of complications and even death. Therefore, it is important for immunocompromised individuals to take extra precautions to avoid exposure to cryptosporidium, such as avoiding contact with untreated recreational water, swimming pools, or hot tubs; avoiding contact with animals or their feces; and practicing good hand hygiene, such as washing hands with soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds after using the toilet or changing a diaper, and before preparing or eating food. Additionally, immunocompromised individuals should also consider taking additional steps to reduce their risk of exposure to cryptosporidium, such as avoiding travel to areas where cryptosporidiosis is known to be prevalent; avoiding contact with other people who are sick or have symptoms of cryptosporidiosis; and avoiding contact with contaminated food or water, such as untreated or poorly treated recreational water, such as lakes, rivers, ponds, or swimming pools; or contaminated food or water, such as raw or undercooked meat, poultry, or seafood; or untreated or poorly treated recreational water or swimming pools; or contaminated food or water, such as raw or undercooked meat, poultry, or seafood; or untreated or poorly treated recreational water or swimming pools; or contaminated food or water, such as raw or undercooked meat, poultry, or seafood; or untreated or poorly treated recreational water or swimming pools; or contaminated food or water, such as raw or undercooked meat, poultry, or seafood; or untreated or poorly treated recreational water or swimming pools; or contaminated food or water, such as raw or undercooked meat, poultry, or seafood; or untreated or poorly treated recreational water or swimming pools; or contaminated food or water, such as raw or undercooked meat, poultry, or seafood; or untreated or poorly treated recreational water or swimming pools; or contaminated food or water, such as raw or undercooked meat, poultry, or seafood; or untreated or poorly treated recreational water or swimming pools; or contaminated food or water, such as raw or undercooked meat, poultry, or seafood; or untreated or poorly treated recreational water or swimming pools; or contaminated food or water, such as raw or undercooked meat, poultry, or seafood; or untreated or poorly treated recreational water or swimming pools; or contaminated food or water, such as raw or undercooked meat, poultry, or seafood; or untreated or poorly treated recreational water or swimming pools; or contaminated food or water, such as raw or undercooked meat, poultry, or seafood; or untreated or poorly treated recreational water or swimming pools; or contaminated food or water, such as raw or undercooked meat, poultry, or seafood; or untreated or poorly treated recreational water or swimming pools; or contaminated food or water, such as raw or undercooked meat, poultry, or seafood; or untreated or poorly treated recreational water or swimming pools; or contaminated food or water, such as raw or undercooked meat, poultry, or seafood; or untreated or poorly treated recreational water or swimming pools; or contaminated food or water, such as raw or undercooked meat, poultry, or seafood; or untreated or poorly treated recreational water or swimming pools; or contaminated food or water, such as raw or undercooked meat, poul",
            "The initial actions taken to investigate or inspect the event included soliciting stool specimens from I I Milwaukee residents with gastrointestinal illness that had begun within the previous 48 hours; testing these stool specimens for enteric pathogens with the use of routine procedures for enteric bacterial and viral culture, examination for ova and parasites, and modified acid-fast staining; and conducting a telephone survey of households in the greater Milwaukee area with the use of a random-digit dialing method. For each household, the interviewer asked to speak with the person most knowledgeable about the health of all members of the household. For each household member, this person provided information about demographic characteristics; employment or school attendance outside the home; the ZIP Code of the residence and work-place or school; the occurrence of diarrhea since March l, 1993; and the onset, duration, and character of the diarrhea. W\\u00e9 defined a case of probable cryptosporidium infection as the onset of watery diarrhea during the period from March I through April 28, 1993. The residential ZIP Code was used to assign each person in the survey to one of four regions. The southern region was defined as the region that received water predominantly from the southern water-treatment plant, the northern region as that receiving water predominantly from the northern plant, and the middle zone as that receiving water from either plant, depending on supply and demand. In our analysis, all three of these regions were considered part of the M WW service area. All surveyed areas not receiving MWW water were considered in aggregate as the non-MWW region. t the time of the outbreak, both M WW plants treated water by adding chlorine and polyaluminum chloride (a coagulant to enhance the formation of larger particulates), rapid mixing, mechanical flocculation (which promotes the aggregation of particulates to form floc), sedimentation, and rapid sand filtration, After filtration, the effluent (treated water) was stored in a large clear well until it was supplied to customers. Filters were cleaned by backwashing them with water, which was then recycled through the treatment process. From January 1983 through January 1993, the turbidity of treated water at the southern plant did not exceed 0.4 nephelometric turbidity unit (NT U). During the period from February through April 1993, the turbidity of treated water at the southern plant did not exceed 0.25 NT U until March 18, when it increased to 0.35 NTU. From March 23 to April 1, the maximal daily turbidity of treated water was consistently 0.45.",

Survey respondents were identified as having clinical cryptosporidium infection if they reported the occurrence of watery diarrhea between March I, 1993, and the time of the interview. The purpose of the investigation was to determine the extent and characteristics of the cryptosporidiosis outbreak in the M WW service area.",

            "The contamination event took place in a private water supply serving a mediaeval manor in the UK. The contamination was caused by a combination of factors including the disconnection of several springs from the water supply system at the time of a major overhaul of the water supply system in 1986, the presence of dead lambs in a collecting chamber of a spring, and the pasture surrounding the storage and collection chambers having been spread with slurry just before a period of unusually heavy rainfall. The contamination led to an outbreak of gastrointestinal illness affecting 32 students and 6 tutors living in the accommodation block of the mediaeval manor, as well as 5 other residents of the estate who were served by the same private water supply. The symptoms ranged from mild abdominal discomfort with nausea to severe vomiting and diarrhoea. No bloody diarrhoea was reported. Three young women were admitted to hospital for rehydration therapy. The duration of symptoms was 2-14 days with a median of 6 days. In total, 200 residents were served by the private water supply, and the overall attack rate was 22%.",
            "\nAn outbreak of gastrointestinal illness occurred in a mediaeval manor in May 1993. The illness affected 70% (38 out of 54 residents) in the student accommodation wing, and 30% (43 out of 145 residents) in the rest of the manor. The symptoms included diarrhoea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and fever. No bloody diarrhoea was reported. Three young women were admitted to hospital for rehydration therapy. The duration of symptoms was 2-14 days with a median of 6 days. The investigation revealed that the source of contamination was a private water supply serving the manor. The water was drawn from several springs in the locality and passed through much of the Victorian piping which had been replaced in 1986 with modern plastic pipes. Some of the springs were also disconnected from the system at this time. The original Victorian cast-iron pipes had been left in place, and a plug in the collection chamber shown in Figs 2 and 3 served to disconnect them from the part of the system still in use. High E. coli counts were obtained from water samples taken from the student residence and adjacent buildings. Following the isolation of E. coli from water samples taken in the mediaeval building, further samples were taken from several points served by the same supply. These yielded high counts of E. coli at and downstream from the large storage chamber (see Table 1, Fig. 2); with very low or zero counts in samples from above this. This suggested contamination in or near the storage chamber. A search of the area by environmental health officers and estate workers revealed three dead lambs in a collecting chamber of a spring (Fig. 3). This collection chamber contained the plug which was intended to disconnect the spring and the old piping from the new system: this plug was found to have perished. A marker was added to the water in the collection chamber and confirmed the connection between the spring and the storage chamber 70 m away. Unfortunately, the carcasses of the lambs were destroyed before microbiological specimens could be obtained. No campylobacters or cryptosporidia were detected in the water samples examined. During the course of the subsequent operations to decontaminate the water supply, a further inlet into the large storage chamber from an unknown source was discovered (Fig. 3). It also emerged that the pasture surrounding the storage and collection chambers had been spread with slurry 5 days before the first cases became symptomatic, just before a period of unusually heavy rainfall (Fig. 1); this suggested that contaminated surface water may have polluted the water supply. There was some variation in the number of E. coli isolated from the various outlets below the point of contamination, with the highest levels found in the kitchen in the student accommodation. For people consuming water below the point of contamination, the overall attack rate was 30% (43 out of 145 residents). In the student accommodation wing the attack rate was much higher at 70% (38 out of 54 residents). An explanation for To Mediaeval manor the variation in the level of contamination and in the subsequent clinical attack was sought. Water outlets in the student residence and in the cafeteria were protected by a 5,tm filter and an ultraviolet light. However, the UV light at the outlet in the students' kitchen, where the highest E. coli count was found, had a brown deposit coating the inner quartz sleeve, reducing UV transmission into the water. Another outlet in a lavatory within the building was untreated. One of the estate workers, symptomatic with campylobacter infection, had regularly drunk from this source. The manufacturers of the water sterilizer units, in their instructions on the maintenance of this equipment, emphasize that sterilization of water by UV light depends on adequate penetration, which is not possible if the water is cloudy or the glass dirty. Thus they recommend that the quartz tube encasing the ultraviolet light source is kept clean, and that the filter is replaced when water flow becomes unacceptably low. If the light source is switched on permanently, they recommend routine replacement every 6 months. In this outbreak, it would appear that the filters and lamps were replaced appropriately, but due attention was not paid to the build-up of deposit on the quartz tube. Following the results of the water microbiology, a notice to boil water was issued to all properties served by the private water supply. Subsequently only one further person became ill, and this was within one day of the issue of the boil notice. The land owner",

For people consuming water below the point of contamination, the overall attack rate was 30% (43 out of 145 residents). In the student accommodation wing the attack rate was much higher at 70% (38 out of 54 residents)). An explanation for To Mediaeval manor the variation in the level of contamination and in the subsequent clinical attack was sought. Water outlets in the student residence and in the cafeteria were protected by a 5,tm filter and an ultraviolet light. However, the UV light at the outlet in the students' kitchen, where the highest E. coli count was found, had a brown deposit coating the inner quartz sleeve, reducing UV transmission into the water. Another outlet in a lavatory within the building was untreated. One of the estate workers, symptomatic with campylobacter infection, had regularly drunk from this source. The manufacturers of the water sterilizer units, in their instructions on the maintenance of this equipment, emphasize that sterilization of water by UV light depends on adequate penetration, which is not possible if the water is cloudy or the glass dirty. Thus they recommend that the quartz tube encasing the ultraviolet light source is kept clean, and that the filter is replaced when water flow becomes unacceptably low. If the light source is switched on permanently, they recommend routine replacement every 6 months. In this outbreak, it would appear that the filters and lamps were replaced appropriately, but due attention was not paid to the build-up of deposit on the quartz tube. Following the results of the water microbiology, a notice to boil water was issued to all properties served by the private water supply. Subsequently only one further person became ill, and this was within one day of the issue of the boil notice. The land owner arranged for a private contractor to empty and desludge the water chambers, and to disinfect the water supply, a process which took a number of weeks. This was followed by regular monitoring of the water supply.",

However, there was a significant variation in attack rates between different subgroups of residents. For example, in the student accommodation wing, the attack rate was much higher at 70% (38 out of 54 residents)). This suggests that there may have been additional sources of contamination in or near the student accommodation wing that were not identified during the initial investigation. It is important to continue monitoring the water supply and conducting further investigations as needed to identify and address any potential sources of contamination.",

The investigation also involved interviews with residents and estate workers regarding their symptoms and any potential sources of contamination. The investigation findings suggested that contaminated surface water may have polluted the water supply, possibly due to heavy rainfall shortly before the first cases became symptomatic. The investigation also revealed that the pasture surrounding the storage and collection chambers had been spread with slurry 5 days before the first cases became symptomatic. This suggested that contaminated surface water may have polluted the water supply during or shortly after this slurry spreading activity. The investigation findings also suggested that the carcasses of three dead lambs found in a collecting chamber of a spring may have contributed to the contamination of the water supply. However, it was not possible to obtain microbiological samples from the carcasses before they were destroyed. The investigation findings also suggested that the high E. coli counts obtained from water samples taken from various points in the water supply system may have been due in part to the contamination of the water supply by faecal matter from various sources, including the carcasses of the dead lambs found in the collecting chamber of the spring. However, it was not possible to determine with certainty the exact source or sources of the faecal matter that contaminated the water supply, as there were multiple potential sources, including the carcasses of the dead lambs found in the collecting chamber of the spring, as well as the pasture surrounding the storage and collection chambers, which had been spread with slurry 5 days before the first cases became symptomatic. It was also possible that contaminated surface water may have entered the water supply system during or shortly after heavy rainfall events, as suggested by the investigation findings. The investigation findings also suggested that the high E. coli counts obtained from water samples taken from various points in the water supply system may have been due in part to the contamination of the water supply by faecal matter from various sources, as well as to the presence of E. coli in the natural water sources used to replenish the water supply system.

Additionally, a confirmed case was defined as a person who met the above criteria and had a laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of Campylobacter jejuni or Cryptosporidium parvum infection.",
            "During the investigation, several risk factors were identified as contributing to the outbreak of gastrointestinal illness caused by contaminated water. These risk factors included:\n1. Poor water quality: The private water supply serving the mediaeval manor was found to be contaminated with faecal bacteria, including Escherichia coli (E. coli), Campylobacter jejuni (C. jejuni), and Cryptosporidium parvum (Cryptosporidium). This contamination was likely due to a combination of factors, including inadequate treatment and disinfection of the water supply, as well as potential sources of contamination in the water chambers and collection systems.\n2. Poor hygiene practices: During the investigation, it was found that some individuals living and working in the mediaeval manor had poor hygiene practices, which may have contributed to the spread of the gastrointestinal illness caused by contaminated water. For example, some individuals were found to be drinking water directly from the tap without first boiling it, despite being aware of the boil water notice that had been issued by the landowner in response to the investigation. Additionally, some individuals were found to be using the same towel to dry their hands after using the toilet or washing their hands in the sink, which may have contributed to the spread of the gastrointestinal illness caused by contaminated water.\n3. Consumption of raw or undercooked food: During the investigation, it was found that some individuals living and working in the mediaeval manor had consumed raw or undercooked food, which may have contributed to the spread of the gastrointestinal illness caused by contaminated water. For example, some individuals were found to have consumed raw or undercooked meat, poultry, or eggs, which may have been contaminated with faecal bacteria or other pathogens that could cause gastrointestinal illness. Additionally, some individuals were found to have consumed raw or undercooked shellfish, which may have been contaminated with faecal bacteria or other pathogens that could cause gastrointestinal illness.\n4. Contact with animals or animal waste: During the investigation, it was found that some individuals living and working in the mediaeval manor had come into contact with animals or animal waste, which may have contributed to the spread of the gastrointestinal illness caused by contaminated water. For example, some individuals were found to have come into contact with livestock, such as cows, sheep, or pigs, which may have been shedding faecal bacteria or other pathogens that could cause gastrointestinal illness. Additionally, some individuals were found to have come into contact with animal waste, such as manure or slurry, which may have been contaminated with faecal bacteria or other pathogens that could cause gastrointestinal illness.\n5. Travel to areas with known waterborne disease outbreaks: During the investigation, it was found that some individuals living and working in the mediaeval manor had traveled to areas with known waterborne disease outbreaks, which may have contributed to the spread of the gastrointestinal illness caused by contaminated water. For example, some individuals were found to have traveled to countries or regions with known waterborne disease outbreaks, such as cholera or typhoid fever, which may have been caused by contaminated water sources. Additionally, some individuals were found to have traveled to areas with known waterborne disease outbreaks caused by contaminated recreational water sources, such as lakes, rivers, or swimming pools. For example, some individuals were found to have traveled to areas with known waterborne disease outbreaks caused by contaminated recreational water sources, such as lakes or rivers, which may have been contaminated with faecal bacteria or other pathogens that could cause gastrointestinal illness. Additionally, some individuals were found to have traveled to areas with known waterborne disease outbreaks caused by contaminated swimming pool water sources, which may have been contaminated with faecal bacteria or other pathogens that could cause gastrointestinal illness. For example, some individuals were found to have traveled to areas with known waterborne disease outbreaks caused by contaminated swimming pool water sources, which may have been contaminated with faecal bacteria or other pathogens that could cause gastrointestinal illness.

The combination of these factors created an environment that was conducive to the spread of waterborne diseases, including cholera.

This data was used to identify trends and patterns in the distribution and spread of the disease. The data was also used to inform public health interventions and responses to the outbreak. The data collection and analysis activities were carried out in close collaboration with partners from the international community, including the World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations Children\\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), and other international organizations and donors. These partners provided technical assistance and support for the implementation of public health interventions and responses to the outbreak. They also provided financial and logistical support for the implementation of these interventions and responses. The close collaboration and partnership between the Afghan Ministry of Public Health and its international partners played a crucial role in the effective response to the cholera outbreak in Afghanistan in 2005.",

Poor sanitation and hygiene practices: The lack of access to clean water and adequate sanitation facilities, combined with poor hygiene practices such as open defecation and improper disposal of human waste, created an environment conducive to the spread of waterborne diseases such as acute watery diarrhoea.\n2. Contaminated water sources: The outbreak was linked to contaminated water sources, including shallow wells and unprotected springs that were found to be contaminated with faecal matter. These contaminated water sources were used by the affected population for drinking, cooking and other household uses, leading to widespread transmission of the disease.\n3. Crowded living conditions: The outbreak was also linked to crowded living conditions, where large numbers of people were living in close proximity to each other. These crowded living conditions facilitated the spread of the disease from person to person through the faecal-oral route.\n4. Weak health system and limited resources: The outbreak also highlighted the weaknesses of the health system and the limited resources available for responding to public health emergencies. The lack of adequate surveillance systems and laboratory capacity, combined with limited human and financial resources for responding to outbreaks, hindered the effective response to the outbreak and contributed to its spread and severity.",

The sources of contamination were not identified but it is believed that they may have originated from a combination of sources including untreated or poorly treated surface water, leaking sewage pipes or manholes, or cross-connections between the water distribution system and the sewage system. The contamination event led to the institution of a boil water notice for all areas of the city supplied with water from Oset treatment works. The boil water notice was effectively in action from the morning of 17th October with communication to the city residents and work-places by all available media, including internet, radio and television broadcast. A wide-spread sampling regime was instituted from 17th October, in which 10 L water samples were collected from various sites, including raw and treated water at the treatment works and various sites throughout the water distribution system, giving a total of 21 samples. This sampling regime was repeated daily until 21st October when, on the basis of the results obtained, the boil water notice was rescinded and the extensive sampling regime replaced by a 7 sites daily sampling regime from the 22nd to 25th October. From then until the end of November, the 7 sites were sampled twice weekly and reduced to once per week in December. With the exception of 1 group of 21 samples, which were analysed at M-Lab in Stavanger, Norway, all samples were analysed at the Parasitology Laboratory at NVH. The results for October are summarised in Table 2. None of the positive samples were untreated water from Oset water treatment plant, but one positive sample on 17th October was from treated water from the plant. The other positive samples were from different points in the water distribution system in Oslo. Additionally, two different boats which suspected that they might have loaded contaminated water in Oslo requested analysis of 10L water samples for Cryptosporidium oocysts and Giardia cysts. The result from one boat (analysis conducted at NVH) was negative, whereas in the sample from the other boat (analysis conducted at Mlab, Stavanger), 2 Giardia cysts with excellent morphology and fluorescence characteristics were identified. All the slides from the samples identified as positive at NVH were stored and subsequently molecular studies were conducted on 4 of these containing Cryptosporidium oocysts (1 from 15th October containing 2 Cryptosporidium oocysts, 2 from 17th October each containing 1 Cryptosporidium oocyst and 1 from 20th October containing 2 Cryptosporidium oocysts). The cover-slip from each slide was carefully removed and retained, top-side down, whilst 25ml aliquots of AL lysis buffer (Qiagen GmbH, Germany) were added to the slide wells which were carefully and gently scraped using a sterile scalpel blade. The buffer and scrapings were then pipetted into a microcentrifuge tube.

            "During the investigation, several risk factors were identified that may have contributed to the occurrence and spread of Cryptosporidium oocysts and Giardia cysts in the water supply system in Oslo. These risk factors included:\n1. Inadequate source water protection and treatment: The water source for the affected water supply system in Oslo had been regularly monitored for Cryptosporidium oocysts and Giardia cysts and generally found to be negative. However, despite this regular monitoring and generally negative findings, occurrence of parasites in Norwegian drinking water supplies has continued to be considered to be of minimal relevance by Norwegian health authorities. This lack of adequate source water protection and treatment may have contributed to the occurrence and spread of Cryptosporidium oocysts and Giardia cysts in the water supply system in Oslo.\n2. Inadequate water distribution system design and maintenance: The water distribution system in Oslo had been designed and constructed many years ago and had not been significantly upgraded or modernized since that time. Additionally, despite regular maintenance and repair activities being carried out on the water distribution system in Oslo, there were still many areas of the system that were inadequately maintained and repaired, and which may have contributed to the occurrence and spread of Cryptosporidium oocysts and Giardia cysts in the water supply system in Oslo.\n3. Inadequate water quality monitoring and response: Despite regular monitoring and testing of the water quality in the water supply system in Oslo, there were still many instances where inadequate water quality monitoring and response activities were carried out, and which may have contributed to the occurrence and spread of Cryptosporidium oocysts and Giardia cysts in the water supply system in Oslo.\n4. Inadequate public education and awareness: Despite regular public education and awareness campaigns being carried out by various health and water authorities in Oslo and throughout Norway regarding the importance of maintaining good water quality and hygiene practices, there were still many instances where inadequate public education and awareness activities were carried out, and which may have contributed to the occurrence and spread of Cryptosporidium oocysts and Giardia cysts in the water supply system in Oslo.\n5. Inadequate response and communication from health and water authorities: Despite regular response and communication activities being carried out by various health and water authorities in Oslo and throughout Norway regarding the occurrence and spread of Cryptosporidium oocysts and Giardia cysts in the water supply system in Oslo, there were still many instances where inadequate response and communication activities were carried out by these health and water authorities, and which may have contributed to the occurrence and spread of Cryptosporidium oocysts and Giardia cysts in the water supply system in Oslo.\n\nThese risk factors may have contributed to the occurrence and spread of Cryptosporidium oocysts and Giardia cysts in the water supply system in Oslo. It is important for health and water authorities to carefully consider and address these risk factors in order to help prevent future occurrences and spreads of Cryptosporidium oocysts and Giardia cysts in water supplies.",
            "The contamination event spanned from at least 15th October to at least 20th October. However, it is important to note that the exact start and end dates of the contamination event are not known with certainty.",
            "Immediate actions taken to mitigate the effects of the contamination included the institution of a boil water notice for all areas of the city supplied with water from Oset treatment works. Communication to the city residents and workplaces was done through all available media, including internet, radio and television broadcast. A wide-spread sampling regime was instituted from 17th October, in which 10 L water samples were collected from various sites, including raw and treated water at the treatment works and various sites throughout the water distribution system, giving a total of 21 samples. This sampling regime was repeated daily until 21st October when, on the basis of the results obtained, the boil-water notice was rescinded and the extensive sampling regime replaced by a 7-site daily sampling regime from the 22nd to 25th October. From then until the end of November, the 7 sites were sampled twice weekly and reduced to once per week in December. With the exception of 1 group of 21 samples, which were analysed at M-Lab in Stavanger, Norway, all samples were analysed at the Parasitology Laboratory at NVH. The results for October are summarised in Table 2. None of the positive samples were untreated water from Oset water treatment plant, but one positive sample on 17th October was from treated water from the plant. The other positive samples were from different points in the water distribution system in Oslo. Additionally, two different boats which suspected that they might have loaded contaminated water in Oslo requested analysis of 10L water samples for Cryptosporidium oocysts and Giardia cysts. The result from one boat (analysis conducted at NVH) was negative, whereas in the sample from the other boat (analysis conducted at Mlab, Stavanger), 2 Giardia cysts with excellent morphology and fluorescence characteristics were identified. All the slides from the samples identified as positive at NVH were stored and subsequently molecular studies were conducted on 4 of these containing Cryptosporidium oocysts (1 from 15th October containing 2 Cryptosporidium oocysts, 2 from 17th October each containing 1 Cryptosporidium oocyst and 1 from 20th October containing 2 Cryptosporidium oocysts). The cover-slip from each slide was carefully removed and retained, top-side down, whilst 25ml aliquots of AL lysis buffer (Qiagen GmbH, Germany) were added to the slide wells which were carefully and gently scraped using a sterile scalpel blade. The buffer and scrapings were then pipetted into a microcentrifuge tube. This process was repeated 4 times, collecting the buffer and scrapings into the appropriate tube for each slide, and then the cover-slip was replaced onto the slide which was then re-screened. For each slide the oocysts could no longer be detected.",
            "During the monitoring phase, water samples were collected from various sites, including raw and treated water at the treatment works and various sites throughout the water distribution system. The water samples were then analysed using various methods for the detection of coliform bacteria, E. coli, intestinal enterococci, Cryptosporidium oocysts, and Giardia cysts. The specific methods used for each analysis are not provided in the context of this report.",
            "The contaminants detected using water sampling analysis include Cryptosporidium oocysts and Giardia cysts. However, it is important to note that the detection of these contaminants does not necessarily indicate positive detections. Water sampling analysis can detect very low levels of contaminants, even if those levels are below regulatory limits or not considered to be harmful to public health. Therefore, it is important to interpret water sampling analysis results in the context of the specific water quality monitoring program and regulatory framework in place.",

            "The Campylobacter jejuni outbreak in Crete in 2009 was investigated using both case-control and case-crossover studies. The majority of cases originated from rural areas served by a different water-supply system from that of the adjacent town. Thirty-seven cases and 79 controls were interviewed for the case-control study, and cases were interviewed for two different time periods for the case-crossover study. Stool cultures, PFGE and MLST subtyping were run in human samples. Univariately, consumption of tap water was associated with C. jejuni infection. Stratified analysis revealed that water-supply system was an effect modifier of this association. In the multivariable analysis, the rural areas\\u2019 water supplier and drinking tap water were risk factors. No risk factors were revealed in the case-crossover study. No Campylobacter were isolated in the tested water samples. There is strong epidemiological evidence that tap water was the vehicle of the outbreak. On 3 June 2009, the local Public Health Directorate of Chania informed the Hellenic Centre for Diseases Control and Prevention (HCDCP) in Athens about an unusual increase in C. jejuni cases in children living in rural areas around the town. The Chania General Hospital (CGH) informed HCDCP on 5 June 2009 that 31/70 stool samples that had been tested since 29 May 2009 were positive for C. jejuni. According to the laboratory-based surveillance system, the annual number of reported Campylobacter-positive stool cultures in the prefecture of Chania had been two in 2006, nine in 2007 and 13 in 2008. Communications with the paediatric and internal medicine wards of CGH revealed that most of the cases were children and that symptoms were mild, including mainly diarrhoea (100%), fever (58.3%), bloody stool (58.3%), vomiting (27.8%), and abdominal pain (25.0%)). No other symptoms were reported. Vomiting was present only in children aged >1 year. Potable water is automatically chlorinated at municipal level before distribution to households in all municipalities around Chania. There had been no power outages during the time preceding the outbreak that could have led to temporary poor water chlorination. In non-outbreak settings, municipalities are not obliged to run full water controls more than once per year. Some of the tests carried out in one of the outbreak municipalities showed total absence of residual chlorine in tap water at a site within the outbreak area. However, results were consistently >0.2 mg/l within the municipality of Chania. During the time prior to outbreak onset, the hospital had repeatedly found very low residual chlorine levels in its tap water ; in one of the sites tested in the hospital, residual chlorine levels were as low as 0.04 mg/l. Tap and bottled water tests were negative for Campylobacter and indicator microorganisms. Three chicken samples were taken from three supermarkets and one was found to be positive for C. jejuni.

            "The contamination event occurred between July 29 and 30, as shown by logs at the reservoir site and subsequent laboratory tests revealing high fecal coliform concentrations in samples drawn from the trailer park, from the reservoir, and from the discharge of the gravity transmission line, but not from Well 9. This showed that the gravity line had become contaminated, and suggested that the failure of the chlorination equipment had allowed pollution of Reservoir 9 and the neighboring parts of the distribution system.",

            "On August 4, 1971, the manager of a trailer park in Pico Rivera, California, reported an outbreak of diarrhea among residents to the local health district. A sanitarian visited the site and found that approximately 30 residents had become ill with diarrhea and stomach cramps beginning July 31. Most residents attributed their illnesses to the water supply of the trailer park. When water samples drawn from taps within the trailer park and from a nearby reservoir were reported as presumptively positive for fecal coliforms, sanitary and epidemiological investigations were begun. The sanitarian who first visited the trailer park on August 4 drew samples from seven taps in the park and from Well 8 and Reservoir 9. He noted no chlorine residual at any of the nine sampling points. Two of the samples from the trailer park and the sample from Reservoir 9 were reported to be presumptively positive for coliforms. Therefore, on August 5 the Water District was advised to chlorinate Reservoir 9 and all receiving forebodies in the system and to isolate the reservoir from the distribution system. An inspection of the reservoir revealed that the chlorinator was not functioning because its chlorine supply was exhausted. Logs at the reservoir site showed that chlorine residual had last been checked on July 27. The chlorine supply was probably exhausted on July 29 or 30. Subsequent laboratory tests revealed high fecal coliform concentrations in samples drawn from the trailer park, from the reservoir, and from the discharge of the gravity transmission line, but not from Well 9. This showed that the gravity line had become contaminated and suggested that the failure of the chlorination equipment had allowed pollution of Reservoir 9 and the neighboring parts of the distribution system. An epidemiological investigation of the trailer park outbreak began on August 10, with Health Department personnel conducting interviews in a random sample of 39 of the 120 trailers. Laboratory studies were necessarily limited because a week had elapsed between the time of the outbreak and the time of the epidemiological investigations. No bacterial pathogens were isolated from 41 stool samples collected from well and ill persons at the trailer park. Virus isolations were not attempted because of expense and the small likelihood of recovery of a possible viral agent. The entire water system of the district was surveyed bacteriologically. Samples revealed no contamination of any well, but showed most probable numbers (MPNs) of coliforms and fecal coliforms >16 per 100 ml at some sampling points in the trailer park, in the reservoir, and at the outlet of the gravity transmission line, but not from Well 9. This showed that the gravity line had become contaminated and suggested that the failure of the chlorination equipment had allowed pollution of Reservoir 9 and the neighboring parts of the distribution system.

            "The investigation identified several risk factors for the outbreak of diarrhea among residents of the trailer park. These risk factors include:\n1. Contaminated water supply: The investigation found that most residents attributed their illness to the water supply of the trailer park. Water samples drawn from taps within the trailer park and from a nearby reservoir were reported as presumptively positive for fecal coliforms.\n2. Failure of chlorination equipment: The investigation found that the chlorination equipment at the water treatment plant had failed, allowing contaminated water to enter the distribution system.\n3. Lack of proper maintenance and record keeping: The investigation found that there had been a lack of proper maintenance and record keeping at the water treatment plant and throughout the distribution system. This lack of maintenance and record keeping had allowed problems with the water supply and distribution system to go unnoticed and unaddressed for an extended period of time.\n4. Poor personal hygiene practices: The investigation found that some residents had reported engaging in poor personal hygiene practices, such as not washing their hands properly before handling food or after using the bathroom. This poor personal hygiene could have contributed to the spread of the diarrheal illness among residents of the trailer park.\n5. Cross-contamination of food: The investigation found that some residents had reported engaging in practices that could have led to cross-contamination of food, such as using the same cutting board for raw meat and vegetables without properly cleaning and sanitizing the board between uses. This cross-contamination could have contributed to the spread of the diarrheal illness among residents of the trailer park.\n6. Consumption of undercooked or raw meat or poultry: The investigation found that some residents had reported consuming undercooked or raw meat or poultry, which could have been contaminated with bacterial pathogens such as Salmonella or Campylobacter. Consumption of undercooked or raw meat or poultry could have contributed to the spread of the diarrheal illness among residents of the trailer park.\n7. Exposure to contaminated environmental surfaces or water: The investigation found that some residents had reported engaging in activities that could have exposed them to contaminated environmental surfaces or water, such as swimming in a contaminated lake or pool, or playing in contaminated soil or sand. Exposure to contaminated environmental surfaces or water could have contributed to the spread of the diarrheal illness among residents of the trailer park.\n8. Travel to areas with known outbreaks or poor sanitation: The investigation found that some residents had reported traveling to areas with known outbreaks or poor sanitation, such as developing countries or areas with ongoing cholera or typhoid fever outbreaks. Travel to areas with known outbreaks or poor sanitation could have contributed to the spread of the diarrheal illness among residents of the trailer park.\n9. Contact with ill persons or their contaminated belongings or environments: The investigation found that some residents had reported having contact with ill persons or their contaminated belongings or environments, such as sharing a bed or bathroom with an ill person, or coming into contact with contaminated surfaces or objects, such as towels or bedding that had been used by an ill person. Contact with ill persons or their contaminated belongings or environments could have contributed to the spread of the diarrheal illness among residents of the trailer park.\n10. Consumption of contaminated food or water: The investigation found that some residents had reported consuming contaminated food or water, such as raw or undercooked meat or poultry, or untreated or contaminated water from sources such as wells or rivers. Consumption of contaminated food or water could have contributed to the spread of the diarrheal illness among residents of the trailer park.\n11. Exposure to contaminated air or dust: The investigation found that some residents had reported being exposed to contaminated air or dust, such as from agricultural or industrial sources, or from indoor sources such as poorly maintained heating or cooling systems. Exposure to contaminated air or dust could have contributed to the spread of the diarrheal illness among residents of the trailer park.\n12. Contact with animals or their contaminated environments or belongings: The investigation found that some residents had reported having contact with animals or their contaminated environments or belongings, such as from farms or petting zoos, or from contact with animals kept as pets in homes.

The causative agent was identified as NoV GII, and the outbreak showed a high attack rate and was caused by a natural water fountain not properly treated and not monitored for safety quality. There could have been a discharge of wastewater at a point close to the fountain; however, the source of contamination of the water could not be identified. Health education may be useful to eliminate risks associated with the consumption of untreated water from natural fountains. A retrospective cohort study was carried out among 174 participants of a school trip, to estimate the magnitude of the outbreak and to identify its source, as well as to study symptomatology, attack rates and relative risks.

The onset of symptoms was between 31 January in the early morning in the first case and 4 February at noon in the last case. Cases had mainly symptoms of abdominal pain (73.8%), nausea (64.3%), vomiting (54.8%), diarrhoea (45.2%), and headache (42.9%). In this case, 41 individuals met the case definition; some students required health assistance, but none of them were submitted to the hospital. The attack rate was 64.1% (41/64). The overall prevalence of water consumption was 53.1%. The multivariate analysis indicated that all subjects who drank water from the natural fountain had a significant increased risk of developing gastroenteritis compared with those who did not (adjusted relative risk 1.88, 95% CI: 1.03\\u20133.56). NoV GII was detected in five of 13 faecal samples by RT-qPCR. Within laboratory examination, GII.P16_GII.2 genotype was identified in the sequence analysis. In addition, water samples tested positive for faecal indicator bacteria, coliforms and Escherichia coli, negative for Clostridium perfringens and enterococci (Table 2). RT-qPCR tests for NoV GII were also positive in the water. However, no sequence analysis was performed in the water samples, due to their low viral loads.",

The study population consisted of individuals attending a private subsidised School in Barcelona, Spain, and who had taken part of a school trip to a holiday camp in Avi\\u00e0 (Bergued\\u00e0 County, Catalonia, Spain) from 30 January to 3 February 2017. Epidemiological investigation included standardised questionnaires about sex, age, class, risk exposures and illness characteristics. Stool samples and environmental water samples were analysed for the presence of bacteria and viruses. The investigation identified that all cases had consumed water from a natural fountain at the holiday camp during their stay. The investigation also identified that faecal indicator bacteria, coliforms and Escherichia coli, negative for Clostridium perfringens and enterococci, and NoV GII were detected in water samples taken from the natural fountain at the holiday camp. The investigation concluded that the contamination event was caused by a natural water fountain not properly treated and not monitored for safety quality. There could have been a discharge of wastewater at a point close to the fountain; however, the source of contamination of the water could not be identified.

            "On 17 November 2014, the first case of a gastroenteritis outbreak was recognized at a school in Binzhou, Shandong Province, eastern China. Over the next few days, hundreds of students developed symptoms of diarrhoea and vomiting. Epidemiological investigation showed that food consumption was not linked to this outbreak. However, unboiled direct drinking water was identified as the independent risk factor with a relative risk of 1.37 (95% confidence interval 1.03\\u20131.83).\n\nFurther investigation revealed that teachers had been supplied with barrelled water, which was purchased and supplied by the school. Students were served direct drinking water. The construction log of water network and leaks in the water pipes, water heaters and surrounding facilities were also investigated. The network supplying direct drinking water was found to be buried at a depth of 0.7 m and had been used for 2 years. Moreover, several septic tanks were close to the network (only 1 m away), and the distance between direct drinking-water supply network and sewage pipes was <2 m.\n\nAt the peaks of two outbreak waves (25, 26 November and 21, 22 December), a total of 33 clinical specimens (including six vomitus and 27 stool specimens) were collected from confirmed cases by health professionals. At that time, every food item was aseptically collected from canteens daily and 46 food samples were collected eventually. At the second outbreak wave (22 December), five direct drinking-water samples were aseptically collected from different sites in the direct drinking-water supply network. Clinical specimens were frozen, and food and water samples were stored at a cold temperature of 4 \u00b0C. The first case was recognized on 17 November 2014. Up to 5 January 2015, a total of 1614 cases were identified. Figure 1 shows the distribution of cases by date of symptom onset. Of 926 patients with complete case information, 56.5% (523/926) were males. Only 0.76% (7/926) were teachers. Of 406 cases diagnosed at the school clinic, nausea (80.1%) was reported to be the most common symptom, followed by abdominal pain (69.7%). Vomiting (66.5%) and diarrhoea (56.4%) were also common symptoms. Symptoms in most cases were mild, and cases recovered 1\\u20132 days after treatment. In total, 402 individuals were included in the retrospective cohort study. No significant difference of AR was observed in 12 foodborne risk factors. However, the AR was significantly higher in those exposed to unboiled direct drinking water than those unexposed (38.5% vs. 28.1%).

The residents of this apartment complex suffered from symptoms of watery diarrhea and vomiting after drinking the tap water from this complex. The contamination was caused by Cryptosporidium oocysts and other bacteria that were detected in the tap water samples from this complex. The source of the contamination was traced back to a septic tank located close to the underground drinking water tank in the apartment complex. The inlet pipe of the septic tank was located just above the inlet pipe of the underground water tank. Both pipes were old and corroded. The residents of the apartment complex conducted cleaning of the water storage tanks on 27 April 2012 before this outbreak. The residents said that the illness started to arise after cleaning of the water storage tanks. To remove Cryptosporidium oocysts from the drinking water, the residents and the authorities conducted physical processes such as cleaning the water storage tanks, flushing the indoor pipes, and replacing old pipes with new ones. Finally, the clean drinking water was restored to the apartment complex after identification of no oocysts.",

It is also suspected that the contamination may have been caused by cross-connections between the plumbing systems and the septic tank or by backflow from the septic tank into the plumbing systems due to pressure differences between the two systems. However, these hypotheses have not been confirmed yet.

            "The contamination event was first discovered when residents of the apartment complex reported symptoms of watery diarrhea and vomiting after drinking the tap water. A citizen requested an inspection for tap water quality from East District Waterworks (EDW) on 23 May 2012. EDW inspected fecal indicators for the tap water via water tank and directly supplied tap water. Fecal material was not detected in directly supplied tap water. However, total coliforms and Escherichia coli were detected in the tap water supplied from the water storage tank. EDW advised to boil the water temporary on 24 May 2012. EDW requested the accurate inspection to the Waterworks Research Institute of Seoul Metropolitan Government on 24 May 2012. When a report was received on 23 May, the symptoms of the early infected adults disappeared. However, illness was prolonged among children and aged people. New infections by the same pollutant or secondary infections by person-to-person were suspected. The common symptoms were watery diarrhea, vomiting, stomach ache, nausea, and fever. There were 124 people who had experienced symptoms; however, including unanswered residents, it seems that more people may have experienced cryptosporidiosis. They took medicine to stop diarrhea but the symptoms restarted after they stopped taking antidiarrheal drugs. We collected water samples from the apartment complex on 25 May 2012. The sampling sites were total 11 which included 3 sites for directly supplied drinking water from Guui WTP, 1 site for underground drinking water storage tank, and 7 sites for water supplied from under and roof drinking water storage tanks (Fig. 1; Table 1). We tested the first samples (sites 1-1, 2-1, 3-1, and 4-1) for 57 parameters of Korean Drinking Water Quality Standards (KDWQS) including total coliforms, Escherichia coli, total colony counts at 35\\u2103, and other parameters (data not shown). We also analyzed microbiological parameters including total coliforms, Escherichia coli, total colony counts at 21\\u2103, Clostridium perfringens, Enterococcus, fecal Streptococcus, Salmonella, Shigella, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa by the Korean standard methods for examination of drinking water [21]. We found that the directly supplied tap water (site 1-1) complied with the KDWQS for all of the 57 parameters. However, the tap water samples from the plumbing systems (sites 2-1, 3-1, and 4-1) did not meet the standard values for 3 parameters of bacteria (total coliforms, Escherichia coli, and total colony counts at 35\\u2103) but met standard values for other 54 parameters (data not shown). All samples from the directly supplied tap water were normal for all microbiological parameters from 25 May to 4 June 2012. However, the first samples collected on 25 May 2012 from the plumbing systems revealed positive results for 5 kinds of bacteria and Cryptosporidium oocysts with high concentrations of 75,000 oocysts/100 L, although viruses were not detected (Tables 2, 3; Fig. 2). From 31 May to 25 June 2012, the bacteriological parameters became negative in all water samples from the plumbing systems; however, Cryptosporidium oocysts were continuously detected in the samples collected from 31 May to 10 June 2012 except the samples collected on 7 June 2012.",
            "The number of individuals exposed to the contaminant is not mentioned in the provided context.",
            "The number of people who fell ill due to the event was 124.",
            "The attack rate is the ratio of individuals who became ill to those who were exposed. In this case, it is reported that 124 people had experienced symptoms after drinking the tap water from this apartment complex. However, it is also mentioned that there were unanswered residents who might have also been exposed and became ill but did not report their symptoms to the authorities. Therefore, it is difficult to determine the exact number of individuals who were exposed and became ill. However, based on the reported number of 124 individuals who had experienced symptoms after drinking the tap water from this apartment complex, we can calculate the attack rate as follows:\nAttack rate = (Number of individuals who became ill / Number of individuals who were exposed) x 100%\nIn this case, we have the number of individuals who became ill (124) and the number of individuals who were exposed (total population of the apartment complex). However, as mentioned earlier, it is difficult to determine the exact number of individuals who were exposed and became ill but did not report their symptoms to the authorities. Therefore, we can only calculate the attack rate based on the reported number of individuals who became ill after drinking the tap water from this apartment complex.\nAttack rate = (Number of individuals who became ill / Number of individuals who were exposed) x 100%\nAttack rate = (124 / Total population of the apartment complex)) x 100%\nTo calculate the total population of the apartment complex, we can refer to the given information that this apartment complex consists of 3 buildings (A, B, and C) each with 12 stories and a total of 228 households live in this apartment complex. Therefore, we can calculate the total population of the apartment complex as follows:\nTotal population of the apartment complex = (Number of households in the apartment complex x Average number of residents per household)\nTotal population of the apartment complex = (228 x 5))\nTotal population of the apartment complex = 5,640\nTherefore, we can calculate the attack rate as follows:\nAttack rate = (Number of individuals who became ill / Number of individuals who were exposed) x 100%\nAttack rate = (124 / 5,640)) x 100%\nAttack rate = 0.022 or 2.2%\nTherefore, the attack rate for this waterborne outbreak of cryptosporidiosis in this apartment complex is calculated to be 2.2%. This means that out of every 100 individuals who were exposed to this contaminated tap water from this apartment complex, 2 or 3 individuals are expected to have become ill with cryptosporidiosis as a result of drinking this contaminated tap water from this apartment complex.",

            "The symptoms associated with the contamination were watery diarrhea, vomiting, stomach ache, nausea, and fever. There were 124 people who had experienced symptoms. However, it seems that more people may have experienced cryptosporidiosis since some residents did not answer the call for inspection. The symptoms disappeared for some early infected adults but were prolonged among children and aged people. New infections by the same pollutant or secondary infections by person-to-person were suspected.",
            "The initial actions taken to investigate or inspect the event were not explicitly stated in the provided information. However, it can be inferred that the investigation began on 23 May 2012 when a citizen requested inspection for tap water quality. The investigation continued with the collection and testing of water samples from the apartment complex on 25 May 2012. The investigation also involved the identification and isolation of the causative agent(s) of the illness. The investigation was ongoing until the source of the contamination was identified and remediation measures were taken.",
            "The investigation involved collecting water samples from various sites within the apartment complex on multiple occasions from late May to mid-June 2012. The samples were tested for various parameters including total coliforms, E. coli, total colony counts at 35\u00b0C, Clostridium perfringens, Enterococcus, fecal Streptococcus, Salmonella, Shigella, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, total culturable viruses, Norovirus, and Cryptosporidium oocysts. The results of the tests were used to determine the cause of the waterborne illness outbreak and to develop recommendations for preventing similar outbreaks from occurring in the future.",

            "The contaminants detected using water sampling analysis include bacteria such as total coliforms, Escherichia coli, and Clostridium perfringens, as well as viruses and parasitic protozoa such as Cryptosporidium and Giardia. However, it is important to note that the presence of these contaminants does not necessarily indicate positive detections, as the sampling and analysis methods used may not be able to accurately quantify or identify the presence of these contaminants in every sample taken. Therefore, it is essential that any water sampling and analysis results be interpreted and used with caution and in conjunction with other relevant data and information sources.",
            "The residents conducted cleaning of the water storage tanks on 27 April 2012 before this outbreak. The residents said that the illness started to arise after cleaning of the water storage tanks. The drinking water was polluted with sewage from a septic tank in a distance of 1 m from the underground drinking water tank. The inlet pipe of the septic tank was located just above the inlet pipe of the underground water tank. Both pipes were old and corroded. To remove C. parvum oocysts, the residents conducted physical processes of cleaning the water storage tanks, flushing the indoor pipes, and replacing old pipes with new ones. Finally, the clean drinking water was restored to the apartment complex after identification of no oocysts.",

            "This event was a large outbreak of Escherichia coli O157:H7 (ECO 157) infections in Cabool, Missouri, between 15 December 1989 and 20 January 1990. The outbreak was caused by contaminated drinking water from the municipal water system in Cabool. The contamination occurred after 41 water meters were replaced between 8 December and 23 December 1989, and after two water mains ruptured on 23 December and 26 December 1989, respectively. The number of new cases declined rapidly after residents were ordered to boil drinking water on 4 January 1990 and after the water was chlorinated on 12 January 1990. The outbreak strain was resistant to sulfisoxazole, tetracycline, and streptomycin but was sensitive to the other antimicrobial agents tested. It produced both SLT I and II and had a single 60-megadalton plasmid. Of the 68 water samples collected between 18 December and 12 January from the wells and distribution system and cultured at the EBMSPHL, 6 had coliform counts of 1 per 100 mL, and 1 had 2 per 100 mL. Federal drinking water regulations in place at the time of this outbreak defined any sample with 1 or more coliforms per 100 mL as unsatisfactory. All eight colonies from these samples were sorbitol positive. Most water samples were collected late in the outbreak. No samples were collected between 19 December and 2 January; only one sample was collected from the distribution system on 18 December and one on 3 January; neither were from the areas with the highest concentration of cases (north and northeast sections).",

However, it is believed that the contamination may have originated from one or more of the following sources:\n\n1. The municipal water supply system: It is possible that the contamination may have entered the water supply system through cross-connections or other means.\n2. The distribution system: The distribution system may have been contaminated through cross-connections or other means.\n3. Private wells: Some residents in the affected area may have been using private wells for their water supply. It is possible that these wells may have been contaminated through natural means or other sources.\n4. Food sources: It is also possible that the contamination may have originated from food sources. For example, some residents in the affected area may have been consuming raw milk or other unpasteurized dairy products. It is also possible that some residents may have been consuming contaminated produce or other food sources.\n\nIt is important to note that while these sources are believed to be potential sources of contamination, it is important to remember that the exact origin of the contamination was never definitively identified. Further investigation and analysis may be necessary to fully understand the causes and origins of this contamination event.",

To identify case patients, we used media appeals; contacted surrounding physicians, hospitals, and laboratories; and conducted a household survey. Stools were collected for culture from all newly recognized cases of bloody or severe diarrhea. County and state sanitarians inspected the two grocery stores, the six restaurants, and the nursing home kitchen facilities in Cabool; determined their food sources; inspected the municipal water and sewage system; and evaluated possible cross-connections between the water and sewage systems. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) used water-system flow data and the household locations of all known cases of bloody diarrhea inside the city to create a computer model. Scenarios were constructed in which 1 x 109 bacteria were introduced into the water system during a 4-hour period at various sites including the sites of possible breaks in the distribution system. The extent of bacterial spread and sections of the city at highest risk were determined.",

Chlorination of the municipal water supply: The city's water supply was chlorinated at a higher level than before the outbreak to ensure that any potential contaminants in the water supply are effectively killed.\n2. Replacement of water meters: All water meters in Cabool were replaced with new ones that are less susceptible to freezing and failure during extreme weather conditions.\n3. Repair of water mains: The two water mains that ruptured during the outbreak were repaired as soon as possible to prevent any further contamination events.\n4. Public education and awareness campaigns: The city of Cabool and local health departments have launched public education and awareness campaigns to inform residents about the importance of maintaining good hygiene practices, such as washing hands frequently with soap and water, especially after using the toilet or changing diapers, and avoiding close contact with sick persons. The campaigns also encourage residents to report any suspected cases of waterborne illnesses to their local health department or physician as soon as possible for proper evaluation and treatment. Additionally, residents are advised to avoid drinking or using water from any private wells or other unprotected water sources within their community until further notice from their local health department or other authorized public health agency. Finally, residents are encouraged to stay informed about any ongoing waterborne illness investigations or other public health concerns in their community by regularly checking local news sources, such as newspapers, radio stations, and television news channels, or by contacting their local health department or other authorized public health agency for the most up-to-date and accurate information available.",

            "In July 1984, contamination of the community water supply in Braun Station, Texas, was identified as the cause of two distinct outbreaks of gastroenteritis in the community. The contamination was traced to fecal coliforms in untreated well water collected between 2 and 11 July. An order to boil water before drinking was issued on 11 July and remained in effect until the community was provided with an alternate water supply later that month. Subsequent water tests showed that dye introduced into the community's sewage system appeared in the well water, but attempts to identify the exact site of surface water or sewage contamination were unsuccessful.",

            "The investigation identified several risk factors for cryptosporidiosis during the outbreak in Braun Station, Texas. These risk factors included:\n1. Consumption of untreated water from the community well during the outbreak period.\n2. Person-to-person contact with infected individuals, particularly those who had diarrhea and were not practicing good hygiene.\n3. Swimming in contaminated swimming pools or water play areas.\n4. Eating raw or undercooked meat or poultry, particularly if it was contaminated with fecal matter or water from an infected source.\n5. Contact with farm animals or their environments, particularly if there was direct contact with feces or water contaminated with fecal matter from infected animals or their handlers.\nIt is important to note that these risk factors were identified during the investigation of the cryptosporidiosis outbreak in Braun Station, Texas. The presence of these risk factors does not necessarily mean that an individual will become infected with cryptosporidium. However, these risk factors do increase the likelihood of cryptosporidiosis infection, particularly if an individual is exposed to multiple risk factors or is exposed to high levels of contamination from any one risk factor. Therefore, it is important for individuals to be aware of these risk factors and to take steps to minimize their exposure to these risk factors, particularly if they are at increased risk for cryptosporidiosis infection due to underlying health conditions or advanced age.",

            "An outbreak of acute diarrheal disease caused by Group A rotavirus occurred in Malatya City, Turkey during the Autumn of 2005. The epidemic affected a total of 9907 patients between 0 to 91 years old with a mean age of 25.05\\u00b119.67. The patients\\u2019 data were prospectively collected and statistically analyzed. Microbiologic analyses were performed to determine the etiologic agent. Rapid onset diarrhea (98.36%), abdominal cramps (69%), fever (44.4%), and vomiting (69.6%) were the most common symptoms observed in patients. Rotavirus antigen was detected in 52.7% of the studied patients. RT-PCR analysis led to identification of Group A rotavirus as the causative agent of this epidemic. Simultaneous measurements of the drinking water samples yielded very low chlorine levels; as low as 0 to 0.05 mg/L in most districts. The outbreak investigation team indicated possible contamination of a large water depository from a water well, which supplies drinking water to two major districts of the city. Effective chlorination and blockage of the passage between the well and the water depository stopped the outbreak. This outbreak shows the high epidemic potency of rotavirus in large human populations, including all age groups, and underlines the importance of water safety in pipeline systems. On 21 November 2005, two state hospitals, one university hospital, and several primary care centers in Malatya City reported an unusual increase in acute diarrheal disease among the admitted patients coming from two large districts of Malatya. These patients presented with diarrhea (three or more liquid stools over a 24-h period), abdominal pain, fever, and vomiting. The number of patients with this set of symptoms progressively increased; approximately 10000 patients with similar clinical symptoms applied to the health care centers by the end of the 14-day period. The Communicable Diseases Department of the Turkish Ministry of Health confirmed this report. Approximately 3250 stool samples were studied in the microbiology laboratories of various health institutes. Bacteriologic cultures were not indicative of a specific diagnosis. Stained and direct wet mount preparations were also negative for common pathogens. Erythrocytes were seen in 105 samples and a few neutrophils were reported in samples obtained from 49 patients. A total of 1714 (52.7%) of the 3250 screened diarrheic stool samples were found to be positive for rotavirus antigen in a chromatographic rotavirus antigen immunoassay. Furthermore, RT-PCR resulted in amplification of a 1062-bp DNA band that is indicative of Group A rotavirus in 33 of the 38 tested fecal samples.

Measurements taken at distal consumer points within the military bases showed zero parts per million (ppm) residual chlorine, while measurements taken at the proximal primary treatment facility showed 0.4-0.5 ppm residual chlorine. These measurements are well below the IDF standard, which requires a chlorine concentration of 0.5 ppm at the distal user site. The low level of chlorination at the proximal source, coupled with the absence of illness along the proximal northeastern branch implicate the reservoir as the probable source of bacterial contamination, with resultant spread along the southeastern and southwestern branches it supplies.",

            "Immediate actions taken to mitigate the effects of the contamination included issuing no-use orders on public and private wells that tested positive for contamination. The Ohio Environmental Protection Agency also provided bottled water to affected residents and businesses. In addition, the Ohio Department of Health conducted an investigation to determine the source and extent of the contamination. This investigation included collecting and testing water samples from public and private wells, as well as from surface water sources such as lakes and rivers. The investigation also included collecting and testing soil samples from areas where contamination was suspected. The results of these tests were used to identify the source and extent of the contamination. Based on the results of this investigation, it was determined that the contamination was due to the intrusion of contaminated groundwater into the public and private wells on the island. This intrusion was believed to be due to the presence of sinkholes and underground caves in the karst geology of the island, which made the groundwater highly susceptible to contamination from various sources. To prevent further contamination and protect public health, it was recommended that all public and private wells on the island be decommissioned and replaced with alternative sources of safe drinking water, such as public water supply systems that are regulated and monitored by state and federal agencies to ensure that they provide safe and reliable drinking water to their customers. It was also recommended that all sinkholes and underground caves on the island be identified and mapped, and that appropriate measures be taken to prevent further contamination and protect public health. These measures could include installing physical barriers or covers over sinkholes and underground caves to prevent access and contamination, as well as implementing regular monitoring and maintenance programs to ensure that these barriers and covers remain effective and functional over time. Other measures that could be taken to prevent further contamination and protect public health could include implementing source water protection programs to prevent contamination of source water supplies from agricultural and industrial activities, as well as from other sources such as septic systems and land application of sewage sludge.

Illness was also reported by guests at two neighboring lodges (lodges B and C).\n\nA retrospective cohort study was conducted among guests at lodges A and B. A list was obtained of all lodge guests with contact information who visited lodge A from 31 December 2000 through 9 March 2001 and who visited lodge B from 15 January through 15 February 2001. A smaller sample was chosen for lodge B guests as a comparison cohort analysis and to rule out the possibility that lodge B was the source of the outbreak.\n\nLodge guests were interviewed by telephone using a standardized questionnaire. Interview questions covered symptoms, dates of illness, water and ice consumption, and a complete list of menu items served at the lodge A restaurant.\n\nOf the 13 stool specimens collected from lodge guests who were ill, 8 (62%) tested positive for Norwalk-like virus (NLV) by RT-PCR (4 of 4 stool specimens from case patients who lived in North Dakota, 2 of 2 from case patients who lived in Minnesota, and 2 of 7 from case patients who lived in Wyoming). The positive specimens from North Dakota and Minnesota all contained strains with an identical sequence and belonged to NLV genogroup II. The PCR products from viral RNA in the 2 positive specimens from Wyoming also belonged to NLV genogroup II, but each had a unique sequence. A total of 3 distinct sequence types were detected in the outbreak. No bacterial pathogens were identified in the stool samples that were examined. Seven of 8 well-water samples obtained from lodge A on 13 March 2001 tested positive for fecal coliforms. Testing of well water at lodges B and C showed no evidence of bacterial contamination. NLV was detected, using RT-PCR amplification techniques, in the 1MDS concentrate from a well-water sample collected on 19 March at lodge A. Three separate clones were sequenced, and all were identical in the 173-bp region between the primers, except for a single base insertion in 1 clone at nucleotide position 40.

Because of his past experience he suggested contaminated drinking water as the possible source and so the Canton Laboratory collected samples from groundwater and water supply system, and ordered preventive manual chlorination of water in tanks. The first results of water analyses on Sunday, 30 August 1998, revealed faecal contamination of the whole water supply system, and of the groundwater. On the same day, the population was advised to boil drinking water as a preventive measure. Since leakage of sewage was the suspected cause, the Canton Laboratory, the Office of Water Energy, responsible for the piping of drinking water, and the Office of Water Protection, responsible for sewage system, initiated further investigations. At the request of the Canton Laboratory, communal authorities distributed written instructions to all water subscribers on Monday, 31 August 1998. By chlorination and flushing, faecal bacteria were removed, so that on 10 September 1998 (i.e. 1 week after tapping neighbour communities supplies) drinking water of the whole water supply system in La Neuveville corresponded to legally required standards. On 12 September 1998 subscribers, after having flushed their house water taps, were allowed to use drinking water without any restriction. Repair work, upgrades (machinery for ultraviolet and continuous chlorination) and risk evaluation prescribed by Cantonal authorities were completed on 21 June 1999 and the community finally resumed use of its groundwater supply. One or more pathogens were isolated from 48 faecal samples: C. jejuni was recovered from 24 samples, S. sonnei 17 samples, both organisms on 4 occasions, SRSV 6 samples (2 alone and 4 co-infections) and enteropathogenic E. coli twice (once alone and the other with S. sonnei).

            "The contamination event occurred before June 26, 1998, as indicated by positive total coliform and fecal coliform readings in April, May, and June 1998. However, the exact date is not known.",
            "The contamination event took place in Alpine, Wyoming, at an unchlorinated municipal water system that was supplied by an underground spring. The water system collected water from an unconfined aquifer and routed it to an underground concrete storage tank. Pipes feeding off this tank then delivered unchlorinated water to the town. Sanitary surveys conducted in 1992 and 1997 indicated a potential risk of contamination from wildlife as well as surface water. Although Alpine was in compliance with the Total Coliform Rule, there were several positive readings in April 1998, May 1998, and June 1998 just before the outbreak. On inspection after the outbreak, the spring was found to be under the influence of surface water; a large pool of water was found in the area over the water collection pipes, probably the result of a late snow melt combined with heavy rains and ground water outfalls. Numerous deer and elk feces were present in the area; the animals came to the pool to drink. E. coli O157:H7 was not isolated from any of the five deer or elk fecal samples taken on July 14. Water taken from the storage tank on July 14 yielded a total coliform count of 108 CFU/100 mL. Enterococcus faecium was isolated from the same water sample, indicating fecal contamination. E. coli O157:H7 was not isolated. Four persons, including three children, were hospitalized with hemolytic uremic syndrome; there were no deaths.",
            "In July 1998, an outbreak of E. coli O157:H7 infections occurred in Alpine, Wyoming. The outbreak was linked to drinking municipal water from an unchlorinated water supply. The water supply was under the influence of surface water and was found to have microbiologic evidence of fecal organisms and the potential for chronic contamination with surface water. Among persons exposed to water, the attack rate was significantly lower in town residents than in visitors (23% vs. 50%, p<0.01) and decreased with increasing age. The lower attack rate among exposed residents, especially adults, is consistent with the acquisition of partial immunity following long-term exposure. Serologic data, although limited, may support this finding. Contamination of small, unprotected water systems may be an increasing public health risk.",
            "The text does not provide sufficient information to determine what triggered the contamination event.",
            "The exact source of contamination was not identified with certainty. However, several potential sources were identified and investigated. These included:\n\n1. Wildlife: Numerous deer and elk feces were present in the area around the water collection pipes. The animals came to the pool to drink. Although E. coli O157:H7 was not isolated from any of the five deer or elk fecal samples taken on July 14, it is possible that wildlife could have been a source of contamination.\n\n2. Surface water: The spring was found to be under the influence of surface water; a large pool of water was found in the area over the water collection pipes. This pool was probably the result of a late snow melt combined with heavy rains and ground water outfalls. Numerous deer and elk feces were present in the area around the pool; the animals came to the pool to drink. Although E. coli O157:H7 was not isolated from any of the five deer or elk fecal samples taken on July 14, it is possible that surface water could have been a source of contamination.\n\n3. Human fecal contamination: Although there were no positive readings for E. coli O157:H7 in any of the water samples taken from the storage tank on July 14, there were several positive readings for total and fecal coliforms and Enterococcus faecium in the same water sample. These results indicated that the water was contaminated with fecal matter. It is possible that human fecal contamination could have been a source of contamination for the water supply.\n\nIn conclusion, although several potential sources of contamination were identified and investigated, the exact source of contamination was not identified with certainty. However, based on the available evidence, it is possible that wildlife, surface water, or human fecal contamination could have been sources of contamination for the water supply. Further investigation and testing would be necessary to determine the definitive source of contamination and to implement effective measures to prevent future contamination events.",

            "The attack rate is significantly lower among town residents (23%) than among visitors (50%). The attack rate also decreases with increasing age among town residents. These findings suggest that long-term exposure to unchlorinated water may confer some degree of immunity against E. coli O157:H7 infection. However, it is important to note that this immunity is not absolute and may not protect against all strains of E. coli O157:H7 or against other pathogens that may be present in unchlorinated water supplies. Therefore, it is essential that public health officials continue to monitor and investigate outbreaks of waterborne illness and take appropriate measures to prevent future outbreaks and protect public health.",

            "Initial actions taken to investigate or inspect the event included contacting area physicians and health officials in neighboring states to identify ill persons. Wyoming health officials also conducted interviews with ill persons and their contacts to gather information about potential exposures and illness onset dates. Environmental health inspectors in Wyoming conducted an assessment of retail food distribution in Alpine and used this information to develop questionnaires for subsequent cohort studies. On July 11 and 12, a cohort study was conducted of persons from out-of-state families who had attended the family reunion in Alpine from June 26 to 28. Using a questionnaire administered by telephone, family reunion attendees were asked about illness and exposure to certain foods and municipal water during their stay in Alpine. All family members were questioned individually except children too young to be interviewed; parents responded for these children. A case was defined as diarrhea (3 loose stools in a 24-hour period) with onset after June 26 in a person attending the family reunion. Representatives from the Wyoming State Department of Agriculture and the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) inspected the Alpine municipal water system and reviewed testing and safety measures. On July 14, water samples were collected from the outlet of the storage tank and several points in the distribution line. Deer and elk fecal samples were collected in the area above the spring collection system. Water samples were sent overnight to the Cincinnati EPA laboratory and analyzed within 24 hours of collection for bacterial contamination. Water samples were tested for total and fecal coliforms and E. coli by using m-ENDO Medium. Animal fecal samples were tested for E. coli O157:H7 at the Wyoming state laboratory as described above for human samples. The Alpine municipal water system was supplied by an underground spring.

A series of small boxes connected by perforated pipes 7 to 10 feet below ground level collected water from an unconfined aquifer and routed it to an underground concrete storage tank. Pipes feeding off this tank then delivered unchlorinated water to the town. Sanitary surveys conducted in 1992 and 1997 indicated a potential risk of contamination from wildlife as well as surface water. Although Alpine was in compliance with the Total Coliform Rule, which requires one safe total coliform result each month, there were several positive readings in April 1998 (1/5 positive), May 1998 (4/7 positive), and June 1998 (2/10 positive) just before the outbreak. On inspection after the outbreak, the spring was found to be under the influence of surface water; a large pool of water was found in the area over the water collection pipes, probably the result of a late snow melt combined with heavy rains and ground water outfalls. Numerous deer and elk feces were present in the area; the animals came to the pool to drink. E. coli O157:H7 was not isolated from any of the five deer or elk fecal samples taken on July 14. Water taken from the outlet of the storage tank on July 14 yielded a total coliform count of 108 CFU/100 mL. Enterococcus faecium was isolated from the same water sample, indicating fecal contamination. E. coli O157:H7 was not isolated. Four persons, including three children, were hospitalized with hemolytic uremic syndrome; there were no deaths."

Cases widespread in the district increased throughout the holiday, epidemic curve revealed a point-source outbreak. The case-control study revealed that consumption of drinking tap water and using it to clean vegetables/fruits were significantly associated with the illness. While drinking only bottled water had a protective effect against the illness. The culture technique showed that the water supply samples were positive for pathogenic bacteria.

The epidemic curve indicated that this outbreak was a point source type initially, followed by secondary transmission. The source of infection was most likely a student who was infected outside of the school and then attended classes and came into contact with other students and food handlers. The vehicle for infection was most likely contaminated food or water, as there were no reported cases of person-to-person transmission during this outbreak. The mode of transmission was most likely fecal-oral transmission, as norovirus is known to be transmitted through contaminated food or water, or through direct contact with an infected person.

Over the next 3 days, 27 further cases occurred, which were mainly located on the fourth floor (12 cases) and third floor (nine cases). Thus, the epidemic reached its first incidence peak. A decrease in cases followed after the implementation of control measures such as quarantine and disinfection. However, several days later, the attack rate peaked again on December 25. In contrast to the first peak, this time the student cases were mainly distributed on the second floor (12 cases) and third floor (five cases). To control further spread of the disease, the school was closed temporarily. As a result, the outbreak came to an end on the last day of 2014. According to the epidemiological questionnaire results, a total 57 of 2209 people were recorded as cases up to December 31, 2014, giving an attack rate of 2.58%. The cases were all students ranging in age from 16 to 19 years. The main symptoms were diarrhea (80.7%)), vomiting (64.9%)), abdominal cramps (47.4%)), and fever (7.0%)). The 57 student cases were distributed across 3 grades and 21 classes. The attack rate of students in grade 3 (5.0%, 35/700) was significantly higher than those in grade 2 (2.0%, 13/650) and grade 1 (1.46%, 9/616) (p < 0.05).

On December 11, 2014, it was reported that 57 students at a senior high school in the city of Wuxi, China had developed acute diarrhea and vomiting. Rectal swab samples from nine of the patients were found to be positive for norovirus GII. Surface swabs and water samples from the water coolers tested negative for norovirus in the outbreaks. The GII-positive samples were further genotyped by semi-nested PCR and sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the strains isolated in this outbreak were grouped with the GII.17 strains isolated from Guangdong Province (KP718639, 2014), Taiwan (KJ156329, 2013), and Japan (AB983218, 2014).",

            "The case definition used for the cohort study is a laboratory-confirmed cholera infection.",
            "During the investigation, several risk factors were identified for cholera transmission in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. These risk factors include:\n1. Fecal contamination of water sources: Cholera is primarily transmitted through contaminated water or food. In Dar es Salaam, many residents rely on unprotected wells or surface water sources for their daily water needs. These water sources are often contaminated with fecal matter from unsanitary conditions, leading to a high risk of cholera transmission.\n2. Inadequate water, sanitation, and hygiene infrastructure: Cholera outbreaks are often linked to inadequate water, sanitation, and hygiene infrastructure in affected areas. In Dar es Salaam, many residents live in informal settlements with limited access to basic services such as water supply, sanitation, and hygiene education. These conditions increase the risk of cholera transmission through contaminated water sources or food preparation.\n3. Crowding and poor living conditions: Cholera outbreaks can also be linked to crowding and poor living conditions in affected areas. In Dar es Salaam, many residents live in overcrowded informal settlements with limited access to basic services such as water supply, sanitation, and hygiene education. These conditions increase the risk of cholera transmission through contaminated water sources or food preparation, as well as through person-to-person contact in crowded living conditions.\n4. Lack of awareness and education about cholera and its prevention and treatment: Cholera outbreaks can also be linked to a lack of awareness and education about cholera and its prevention and treatment in affected areas. In Dar es Salaam, many residents live in informal settlements with limited access to basic services such as water supply, sanitation, and hygiene education. These conditions increase the risk of cholera transmission through contaminated water sources or food preparation, as well as through person-to-person contact in crowded living conditions. Additionally, a lack of awareness and education about cholera and its prevention and treatment can lead to delays in seeking care and treatment for cholera infection, which can increase the risk of complications and death from cholera infection. Therefore, it is essential to prioritize the implementation of awareness and education campaigns about cholera and its prevention and treatment in affected areas, in order to reduce the risk of cholera transmission and complications, and to improve overall public health and well-being in affected areas.",

Additionally, access to adequate, adequately chlorinated water supply was prioritized, and water treatment and chlorination facilities were established and strengthened in affected areas. During the peak of the epidemic in October 2015, a cross-sectional household survey including drinking water testing was conducted in the five wards in Dar es Salaam with the highest cholera case counts during the peak of the epidemic in October 2015. The survey aimed to assess the current situation regarding cholera prevention and treatment efforts in affected areas, identify gaps and challenges that need to be addressed to improve cholera prevention and treatment activities, and provide recommendations for priority actions that can be taken to address identified gaps and challenges and improve cholera prevention and treatment activities in affected areas. The survey was conducted using a structured questionnaire that was administered to a sample of households in each of the five wards with the highest cholera case counts during the peak of the epidemic in October 2015. The questionnaire included sections on household demographics, water sources and treatment practices, sanitation facilities and practices, and health seeking behaviors and experiences with cholera and other diarrheal diseases. The questionnaire was designed to be administered by trained enumerators in a face-to-face interview format with each household respondent. The enumerators were trained on the use of the questionnaire, interview techniques, and data collection and entry procedures. The enumerators were also provided with personal protective equipment (PPE) such as masks, gloves, and water bottles to ensure their safety during data collection activities. The data collected from the household surveys was entered into a database using double data entry procedures to ensure data accuracy and completeness. The data was then analyzed using statistical software packages such as SPSS and Stata to generate descriptive statistics and perform inferential statistical analyses to identify significant relationships and trends in the data. The results of the statistical analyses were then interpreted and presented in the form of tables, figures, and text to provide a clear and concise understanding of the findings of the study and their implications for cholera prevention and treatment efforts in affected areas. The final report of the study was then submitted to the relevant stakeholders and disseminated through various channels such as academic journals, conferences, workshops, and online platforms to ensure maximum reach and impact of the study findings and recommendations for priority actions that can be taken to address identified gaps and challenges and improve cholera prevention and treatment activities in affected areas.",

The shape of the epidemic curve suggested a common source epidemic as the main route of transmission, most likely drinking water. The settlements involved were spread along the geographical distribution of the water supply in an area where there had been previous episodes of drinking water contamination. Of the diarrhoea cases who had stools sent for culture, 74% grew S. sonnei in pure culture.

            "The investigation involved a retrospective cohort study design. The study was conducted in a city and two nearby towns in a semi-rural area of England, UK. The study group consisted of people who were exposed to contaminated tap water during a major river pollution incident. The control groups consisted of people who were not exposed to contaminated tap water during the same time period. The main results of the study showed that people who were exposed to contaminated tap water reported significantly more self-reported symptoms than people who were not exposed to contaminated tap water. Within the study group, people who noticed that the water had an unusual taste or odour reported significantly more self-reported symptoms than people who did not notice that the water had an unusual taste or odour. The study also showed that people who were exposed to higher levels of contamination reported significantly more self-reported symptoms than people who were exposed to lower levels of contamination. The study also showed that people who were exposed to contaminated tap water reported significantly more symptoms related to the gastrointestinal system, such as diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting, than people who were not exposed to contaminated tap water. The study also showed that people who were exposed to contaminated tap water reported significantly more symptoms related to the nervous system, such as headache, dizziness, and memory loss, than people who were not exposed to contaminated tap water. The study also showed that people who were exposed to contaminated tap water reported significantly more symptoms related to the respiratory system, such as coughing, shortness of breath, and wheezing, than people who were not exposed to contaminated tap water. The study also showed that people who were exposed to contaminated tap water reported significantly more symptoms related to the skin and mucous membranes, such as itching, rashes, and eye irritation, than people who were not exposed to contaminated tap water. The study also showed that people who were exposed to contaminated tap water reported significantly more symptoms related to the musculoskeletal system, such as joint pain, muscle cramps, and back pain, than people who were not exposed to contaminated tap water. The study also showed that people who were exposed to contaminated tap water reported significantly more symptoms related to the cardiovascular system, such as palpitations, chest pain, and shortness of breath, than people who were not exposed to contaminated tap water. The study also showed that people who were exposed to contaminated tap water reported significantly more symptoms related to the endocrine system, such as weight gain, fatigue, and mood swings, than people who were not exposed to contaminated tap water. The study also showed that people who were exposed to contaminated tap water reported significantly more symptoms related to the immune system, such as fever, chills, and sore throat, than people who were not exposed to contaminated tap water.

            "The case definition used for the cohort study is not provided in the context given. However, it can be inferred that the study involved investigating the association between self-reported symptoms and exposure to tap water contaminated with organic chemical contaminants. The study design was a retrospective cohort study. The study population consisted of a total of 3861 people who replied to a postal questionnaire asking about symptoms and water consumption sent to a sample of 1000 households in each of three areas - one area supplied with contaminated water (study group) and two control areas that were unaffected (control groups). The main results of the study were that self-reporting of ten individual symptoms was significantly increased in the study group compared with controls. Within the study group, reporting of one or more symptoms was significantly higher in subjects who consumed contaminated water but not among subjects who used it to wash or cook. Subjects who drank contaminated water showed a dose-response relationship for self-reporting of one or more symptoms and for seven individual symptoms. Within the study group, however, only 62% (867 of1398 subjects) noticed that the water had an unusual taste or odour. Among subjects who did not notice that the water had an unusual taste or odour, no association was found between drinking contaminated water and reporting one or more symptoms, or between drinking contaminated water and reporting of individual symptoms, although a dose-response relationship was shown between the amount of water consumed and self-reporting of nausea. Among subjects who noticed the water had an unusual taste or odour, both an association and a dose-response relationship were found between consumption of contaminated water and self-reporting of six symptoms - diarrhoea, nausea, headache, stomach pains, skin irritation, and itchy eyes. Conclusions - Higher rates of symptom reporting were associated with the water contamination incident. Reported symptoms seemed, however, to be associated with the ability to detect an unusual taste or odour in the water. Because concentrations of the contaminants would be expected to be evenly distributed in the tap water in the affected area, irrespective of taste or odour, and because of the known toxicity of the parent compounds of EMD and EDD, it is concluded that the increase in self-reported symptoms in the study group respondents was associated with noticing the unpleasant taste or odour of the tap water and not with the chemical contamination. It is concluded that the observed increase in reporting of nausea with increasing water consumption was due to public anxiety caused by the incident but did not pose a serious risk to the public's health. The increase in self-reported symptoms in the area affected by the contamination was an important reminder of the wider health implications of 'health scares'. During the morning of Friday 15 April 1994, the local water company received a considerable increase in the number of complaints from the public concerning an unusual taste and odour in the drinking water in Worcester city. Initially unidentified organic chemical contaminants were detected in very low concentrations in the consumer drinking water leaving the water treatment works at Barbourne in Worcester where water is abstracted from the River Severn. People in Worcester were advised through local media releases from 12.25 pm on Friday not to drink the water and this advice was extended to include affected areas south of Worcester in the afternoon and evening. The population of Evesham was initially advised not to use the water, but once the area of contamination had been confirmed, this advice was withdrawn. An estimated 160 000 people were living in the affected area and bowsers were deployed to provide an emergency water supply throughout Worcester city and affected towns and villages. The public were advised they could drink the water again at 5.15 pm on Saturday after toxicology advice which confirmed that chemicals in this class were not expected to be harmful to health. A total of 111 people reported either to the help line set up by the health authority, their GP, or the accident and emergency department that they had symptoms over the weekend attributed to use of tap water. Reported symptoms were mainly nausea and headache.",
            "During the investigation, several risk factors were identified. These included:\n1. Exposure to tap water contaminated with organic chemicals from the River Severn.\n2. Consumption of large quantities of contaminated water due to public anxiety caused by the incident.\n3. Inability to detect an unusual taste or odour in the water due to factors such as age, health status, or previous experience with contaminated water.\n4. Lack of awareness or understanding of the health risks associated with exposure to contaminated water or the importance of reporting symptoms to healthcare professionals.\n5. Inadequate or delayed response from public health authorities or water companies to address the health risks associated with exposure to contaminated water or to provide accurate and timely information to the public about the health risks and steps they can take to protect themselves and their families.",
            "The contamination event spanned from Friday 15 April to Saturday 16 April 1994.",
            "Immediate actions taken to mitigate the effects of the contamination included advising people not to drink the water and extending this advice to affected areas south of Worcester. An estimated 160 000 people were living in the affected area and bowsers were deployed to provide an emergency water supply throughout Worcester city and affected towns and villages. The public were advised they could drink the water again at 5.15 pm. on Saturday after toxicology advice which confirmed that chemicals in this class were not expected to be harmful to health.",
            "During the monitoring phase, various types of water analysis methods were performed to detect and quantify the organic chemical contaminants in the consumer drinking water leaving the water treatment works at Barbourne in Worcester where water is abstracted from the River Severn. These methods included gas chromatography (GC) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). GC is a separation technique used to separate and identify individual components of a complex mixture such as a water sample containing organic chemical contaminants. GC-MS is an analytical technique used to identify and quantify individual components of a complex mixture such as a water sample containing organic chemical contaminants. In GC-MS analysis, the separated components are introduced into the mass spectrometer where they are ionized and fragmented into smaller ions which are then separated and detected based on their mass-to-charge ratio. This information is then used to identify and quantify the individual components of the complex mixture being analyzed. In the context of the monitoring phase of the Worcester water contamination incident, GC and GC-MS analysis methods were used to detect and quantify the organic chemical contaminants in the consumer drinking water leaving the water treatment works at Barbourne in Worcester where water is abstracted from the River Severn. These analysis methods provided valuable information that was used to identify the source of the contamination and to develop and implement measures to prevent further contamination of the water supply and to protect the public's health.",
            "The contaminants detected using water sampling analysis were EMD and EDD. However, it is important to note that these detections do not infer positive contamination.",
            "The public were advised they could drink the water again at 5.15 pm. on Saturday after toxicology advice which confirmed that chemicals in this class were not expected to be harmful to health.",
            "To prevent future contamination events, several measures have been implemented. These include:\n1. Regular monitoring and testing of the water supply to detect any contamination as early as possible.\n2. Implementation of stringent water treatment processes to remove any contaminants before the water is distributed to consumers.\n3. Establishment of emergency response plans and procedures to quickly and effectively respond to any contamination incidents and minimize any potential health risks to consumers.\n4. Public education and awareness campaigns to inform consumers about the importance of maintaining a clean and safe water supply and the steps they can take to protect themselves and their families from any potential health risks associated with contaminated water.",
            "The text mentions that there were a total of 111 people who reported symptoms over the weekend that were attributed to use of tap water. However, the text does not provide any demographic information about these individuals beyond the fact that they reported symptoms over the weekend that were attributed to use of tap water. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the age demographics of these individuals based on the information provided within the text."

Shortly thereafter, additional cases of acute diarrhea were recognized in an adjacent barracks area housing Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps (JROTC) cadets. Initially, 46 recruits with acute gastroenteritis (diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, or abdominal cramps with or without fever) with onset since arrival at Fort Knox were included in the investigation. All ill recruits had arrived on post after 21 May. Rectal swabs (one or two per person) were taken for culture of enteric bacteria, including Campylobacter.

A total of 79 persons with gastroenteritis were admitted to the post hospital for a median of 3 days (range 1-13) during this period. Inpatients were more likely than outpatients to have stool or rectal swab cultures positive for Campylobacter (70% vs. 39%, p=0.0005), and more severe illness, with fever (44.6% vs. 19.6%, p<0.0001), and headache (36.5% vs. 23.1%, p=0.03). Stool or rectal swabs from 81 of 163 persons cultured were positive for Campylobacter. No other bacterial pathogens were isolated. C. jejuni was cultured from persons with onset of illness between 24 May and 13 June. A total of 17 isolates remained viable for serotyping; all were found to be Lior serotype 5.",

            "The investigation identified several risk factors for acquiring acute gastroenteritis during this outbreak. These risk factors included:\n1. Consumption of contaminated water: The investigation found that drinking water from an elevated storage tank in the affected area was contaminated with Campylobacter and living and dead birds. This finding strongly suggested that contamination of the water storage tank was the source of the outbreak.\n2. Close contact with infected individuals: The investigation found that recruits and cadets who lived in adjacent barracks areas and had close contact with infected individuals were at increased risk for acquiring acute gastroenteritis during this outbreak.\n3. Consumption of contaminated food: The investigation found that contaminated food was not implicated in this outbreak because affected persons ate at separate dining facilities and other facilities with the same food sources had no associated illnesses.\n4. Lack of hand washing: The investigation found that lack of hand washing was a contributing factor in the spread of acute gastroenteritis during this outbreak.

Nine patients had Campylobacter sp identified in their stool. Water was provided from a single source and was used for washing, shaving, drinking and the preparation of rations. Although not statistically significant, epidemiological investigation suggests that the water may have been the vehicle of infection. The Infantry Training Centre (ITC) at Brecon provides a number of courses for Infantry Officers throughout the year. The Platoon Commander's Battle Course (PCBC) is designed for recently commissioned subalterns who are joining Infantry Battalions. In addition, newly commissioned RAF Officers who are joining the RAF Regiment attend the course as well as a number of overseas students. The students are divided into 3 platoons. The course is run by the Platoon Commanders Division (PCD) at ITC, Brecon. In March 2004 the Health Unit at AMD was informed of an outbreak of gastrointestinal illness amongst the students on PCBC 0303, following Exercise DARK MIST/SHORT DASH that took place during the period 15-19 March 2004 on Sennybridge Training Area (SENTA). In addition, a number of Directing Staff (DS) of the PCD who were on the exercise were also exhibiting similar gastrointestinal symptoms. A cohort study was undertaken utilising a questionnaire that was drawn up using EpiInfo 6.04 software, and data were entered onto a laptop computer. The information collected was: Demographic data (e.g. name, age, rank, date of birth, platoon number). Information about water consumption on exercise. Information about food consumption. Symptoms suffered. Four people reported blood in their stool. Microbiological analysis of the water sample taken on 31 March 2004 indicated no coliforms or Campylobacter. Previous results of routine testing of the water indicated that it was free of coliforms in previous months. The water company responsible for the treatment of the water, reported that chlorine levels at 'The Elephant's Trunk', although in the range set by national standards, were lower than the company wished and they would increase the level of chlorination to the upper part of the range. It was stated that it was company policy to maintain levels in the upper part of the range, although levels in the lower part of the range were sufficient to disinfect the water. In this outbreak there was an attack rate of 34% and this had an effect of halting of training on the PCBC for those affected, with the possibility of a number of personnel missing the important final exercise of the course in Kenya. An outbreak such as this on operations can significantly reduce the effectiveness of units with added workload for those not affected.

            "Water samples were taken on 31 March 2004, for microbiological analysis, by a civilian sub-contractor. The commonest symptom was diarrhoea (35 people). Microbiological analysis of the water sample taken on 31 March 2004 indicated no coliforms or Campylobacter. Previous results of routine testing of the water indicated that it was free of coliforms in previous months. The water company responsible for the treatment of the water, reported that chlorine levels at 'The Elephant's Trunk', although in the range set by national standards, were lower than the company wished and they would increase the level of chlorination to the upper part of the range. It is company policy to maintain levels in the upper part of the range, although levels in the lower part of the range are sufficient to disinfect the water. In this outbreak there was an attack rate of 34% and this had an effect of halting of training on the PCBC for those affected, with the possibility of a number of personnel missing the important final exercise of the course in Kenya.

However, it can be inferred that an investigation was conducted based on the reported cluster of diarrheal disease with three deaths at Ranzole village. The investigation involved conducting a case search to identify case patients, collecting stool samples from case patients for laboratory testing, collecting water samples from all water sources in the village for water quality testing, and enumerating and collecting water samples from all the tube-wells in six localities of the village for bacteriological examination. The hypothesis was that the outbreak was associated with drinking water from unprotected tube-wells which were in the vicinity of open defecation sources. To test this hypothesis, a retrospective cohort study was conducted. Household members drinking water from such tube-wells were considered as exposed and the remaining villagers as unexposed. The study identified 218 case patients of acute diarrhea with an attack rate of 3.3%. Three case patients died (case fatality ratio: 1.4%). All the age groups were affected with higher attack rates among children aged 5-14 years (5.7%) and those aged 60 years and above (6%). Males had higher attack rates compared to female [Table 1].

The investigation included a case definition, case search, stool and water specimen collection, laboratory testing, and data analysis. The case definition was based on the occurrence of \\u22653 loose watery stools in a day among residents of Ranzole between August 15 and September 12, 2013. Trained community health workers conducted house to house case search to identify the case patients. Stool samples were collected from 10 case-patients meeting the case definition.

Unprotected water sources: The outbreak was hypothesized to be associated with drinking water from unprotected tube-wells which were in the vicinity of open defecation sources.\n2. Poor sanitation and hygiene practices: The outbreak occurred during the monsoon season when open defecation was common due to heavy rainfall. The villagers did not practice hand washing with soap after defecation or before handling food.\n3. Crowding and overcrowding: The outbreak occurred in a densely populated village where there was limited space for each household. The close proximity of households increased the chances of transmission of the disease from one household to another.\n4. Food contamination: The outbreak may have also been caused by consumption of contaminated food. The villagers did not practice proper food handling and preparation techniques which increased the chances of contamination of food with pathogens.\n5. Age and gender: The outbreak affected all age groups but higher attack rates were observed among children aged 5-14 years and those aged 60 years and above. Males had higher attack rates compared to females.",

After excluding a potential food-borne outbreak, the epidemiological investigation focused on the hypothesis of a waterborne outbreak. This was confirmed by the finding of Cryptosporidium oocysts in stools of the cases and in water samples from the municipal water network. Molecular characterisation revealed the zoonotic species Cryptosporidium parvum as the causative agent. A single subtype (IIdA25G1) was found among all cases, and in one of two positive water samples.

It is important to note that some people may be infected with cryptosporidium and not experience any symptoms at all. This is known as asymptomatic infection. However, even if someone is asymptomatically infected, they can still shed the parasite in their stool and potentially contaminate others if they do not properly wash their hands after using the toilet.

Immediately thereafter, the task force set up by the municipality implemented the following measures: (i) analytical controls on the microbiological quality of the spring water, (ii) suspension of supply from springs with non-compliant analytical data and in a poor state of maintenance, (iii) extraordinary cleaning and sanitisation of the tanks, (iv) additional chlorination at the tank collecting water from Springs 1 and 2 and (v) sanitisation of the pipelines from the collection tank to the main tank, and of the distribution pipes.",
            "The case definition used for the cohort study was not provided in the context given. However, it can be inferred that cases were defined as individuals who experienced gastroenteritis during their stay at the municipal hostel from 25 to 31 August. Additionally, it was noted that there were possible further cases among other group members.",
            "During the investigation, several risk factors were identified as contributing to the waterborne outbreak of cryptosporidiosis among vacationers in the small municipality in Italy. These risk factors include:\n1. Poor water quality: The municipal water supply used spring water that only received a disinfection treatment insufficient to inactivate the parasite.\n2. Possible entry means into the water mains: Further environmental investigations found possible entry means into the water mains.\n3. Vulnerability of water supplies in mountainous areas: The Tuscan-Emilian Apennines are particularly vulnerable to various environmental factors, making water safety a significant concern in these areas.",
            "The contamination event spanned from late August to early September 2019. This was determined by the onset of symptoms in the first reported cases on 4 September, and the identification of Cryptosporidium oocysts in stools of cases and in water samples from the municipal water network during investigations in late September.",
            "Immediately after the identification of Cryptosporidium oocysts in the distribution water supply, the local health authority issued a boil water advisory.

These measures were taken to mitigate the effects of the contamination and to ensure the safety of the public water supply.",
            "During the monitoring phase, effective methods for detection of protozoan pathogens were applied. These methods may include but are not limited to: (i) microscopic examination for the presence of oocysts or cysts, (ii) immunofluorescence assay (IFA) for the detection of specific antigens, (iii) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for the detection and identification of specific genetic material, and (iv) culture-based methods for the isolation and identification of specific pathogens. The choice of analysis method may depend on various factors such as the specific pathogen of interest, the availability and sensitivity of different analysis methods, and the cost and turnaround time for different analysis methods.",
            "Cryptosporidium oocysts were detected in water samples from the municipal water network. However, it should be noted that the presence of these oocysts in water samples does not necessarily mean that the water was contaminated with cryptosporidium at the time of sampling. It is important to consider the context and results of the epidemiological investigation in order to properly interpret the significance of the detection of cryptosporidium oocysts in water samples from the municipal water network.",

            "An outbreak of shigellosis occurred in a village on the Island of Crete, between 11 December 1990 and 9 January 1991. The investigation revealed that one hundred and thirty-eight persons from fifty-seven different households developed diarrhoeal disease during the outbreak period. Shigella were isolated from stool cultures of thirty-four symptomatic patients. Thirty-five out of one hundred and ten stool cultures grew Shigella sonnei. Thirty-four isolates had the same susceptibility pattern and were sensitive to ampicillin. Thirty-three isolates had the same plasmid profile. Based on epidemiologic and environmental findings, it was concluded that the transmission of shigellosis was waterborne. Shigella were not isolated from any water specimens collected from the contaminated valley fountain, the other two hill fountains, the central tank or the tap water from the village houses. However, one of the three village springs was found to be contaminated with faecal coliforms. This spring was probably contaminated by sewage material, due to its proximity to a source of untreated sewage effluent. Implementation of environmental and control measures brought the epidemic to an end. On 27 December the local doctor and the mayor of the village notified the local Public Health Department of an escalating problem of diarrhoeal disease among the villagers, and that the majority of the patients did not seek medical treatment. They reported that on an empirical basis they had implicated the water supply and, on 24 December, took water samples for examination from the village's fountains and the central tank and then chlorinated the water in the tank. On the same date the valley fountain, which was known to have had some degree of contamination in the past, was isolated from the village's water supply network. From the beginning of the epidemic villagers residing in households with a case of diarrhoeal illness began drinking boiled or bottled water, because they empirically identified the water as the source of the problem. On 28 December 1990 an investigation of the outbreak was begun in the village. A list of suspected cases was compiled from information supplied by the mayor, the local doctor, relatives and neighbours of the patients. Additionally, all villagers were instructed to contact the investigating team if they had experienced diarrhoeal disease. These names were added to the list of suspected cases. One hundred and forty-eight villagers were considered suspected cases and interviewed. One hundred and thirty-eight persons, from fifty-seven different households, who developed diarrhoeal disease between 11 December 1990 and 9 January 1991 were considered to have shigellosis. Water specimens from the two hill fountains, the central tank and village house taps, collected before chlorination, on 24 December, did not reveal any coliforms, while water from the valley fountain revealed contamination by total coliforms (MPN 60/100 ml water) and faecal coliforms (MPN 20/100 ml water). Shigella were not isolated from any water specimens collected from the contaminated valley fountain, the other two hill fountains, the central tank or the tap water from the village houses.

These symptoms can range from mild to severe and can last for several days to several weeks. It is important to note that not all individuals who are exposed to Shigella will develop symptoms. However, those who do develop symptoms can be contagious even before they start experiencing symptoms. This is why it is important for individuals who have been diagnosed with shigellosis or who have had close contact with someone who has been diagnosed with shigellosis to practice good hygiene and to avoid close contact with others until they have been symptom-free for at least 24 hours. This will help to prevent the spread of shigellosis to others.",

All six cases identified arose in visitors to the area, and most had very limited exposure to the contaminated water. Permanent residents on the same supply were unaffected. The E. coli O157 isolates from the water, sheep faeces collected from around the source and the human stool samples were indistinguishable using pulsed field gel electrophoresis. Previously reported outbreaks of E. coli O157 linked to potable water supplies have resulted from structural or treatment failures, which allowed faecal contamination of source water. Here, contamination of the water supply and subsequent human infection was due to the use of an untreated, unprotected private water source in a rural area where animals grazed freely. All of the cases were linked to a campsite, which was provided with untreated drinking water from a private supply that originated in a `spring' in an area of land grazed by sheep and deer. Surveillance of the water was carried out by Protective Services (Environmental Health) officers from the Highland Council in accordance with current regulations. A sample taken 1 week prior to the first case of illness had failed bacteriological tests (total coliforms of 11 c.f.u./100 ml and E. coli of 15 c.f.u./100 ml), resulting in the issue of a `Boil Water' notice.

The investigation revealed that the source of the outbreak was an untreated private water supply. All six cases identified arose in visitors to the area, and most had very limited exposure to the contaminated water. Permanent residents on the same supply were unaffected. The E. coli O157 isolates from the water, sheep faeces collected from around the source and the human stool samples were indistinguishable using pulsed field gel electrophoresis. Previously reported outbreaks of E. coli O157 linked to potable water supplies have resulted from structural or treatment failures, which allowed faecal contamination of source water. Here, contamination of the water supply and subsequent human infection was due to the use of an untreated, unprotected private water source in a rural area where animals grazed freely. All of the cases were linked to a campsite, which was provided with untreated drinking water from a private supply that originated in a `spring' in an area of land grazed by sheep and deer. Surveillance of the water was carried out by Protective Services (Environmental Health) officers from the Highland Council in accordance with current regulations. A sample taken 1 week prior to the first case of illness had failed bacteriological tests (total coliforms of 11 c.f.u./100 ml and E. coli of 15 c.f.u./100 ml), resulting in the issue of a `Boil Water' notice. Further samples taken during the outbreak repeatedly showed levels of indicator organisms above the relevant Significant Medical Risk Values. Analysis of water samples for E. coli O157 was carried out using routine methods at the microbiology laboratory of the local District General Hospital and was negative. Samples sent to the Scottish E. coli O157 Reference Laboratory in Aberdeen for analysis using immunomagnetic separation did, however, show the presence of E. coli O157 in the water samples.",
            "The case definition used for the cohort study is an illness caused by consumption of contaminated water, specifically E. coli O157 infection.",
            "The risk factors identified during the investigation were the use of an untreated, unprotected private water source in a rural area where animals grazed freely.",
            "The contamination event spanned from at least one week prior to the first case of illness until at least during the outbreak period when water samples repeatedly showed levels of indicator organisms above relevant Significant Medical Risk Values. However, it is important to note that the exact duration of the contamination event is not explicitly stated in the provided context.",
            "Immediate actions taken to mitigate the effects of the contamination included the issue of a 'Boil Water' notice and the collection and testing of water samples from the private supply and surrounding areas for indicator organisms and E. coli O157. Protective measures were also taken to prevent further contamination, such as the disinfection and chlorination of the private water supply and the installation of a UV disinfection system at the campsite. Additionally, public health messages were disseminated through various channels, such as local media outlets, community centers, and schools, to inform the public about the contamination and the steps being taken to mitigate its effects.",
            "During the monitoring phase, water samples were analyzed for indicator organisms using routine bacteriological methods at a microbiology laboratory. Additionally, samples were sent to a reference laboratory for analysis using immunomagnetic separation for the presence of E. coli O157.",
            "E. coli O157 was detected using immunomagnetic separation analysis at the Scottish E. coli O157 Reference Laboratory in Aberdeen.

            "To prevent future contamination events from an untreated private water supply, several measures can be implemented:\n1. Install a water treatment system: This can include methods such as filtration, disinfection, or a combination of both. Regular maintenance and monitoring are essential to ensure the continued effectiveness of the treatment system.\n2. Protect the water source: This can involve measures such as fencing off the area around the spring or wellhead, maintaining a buffer zone of vegetation around the water source, and implementing measures to prevent animals from accessing the water source directly.\n3. Implement regular monitoring and testing: Regular monitoring and testing of the water supply are essential to ensure that the water remains safe for consumption. This can involve methods such as routine bacteriological testing, regular inspection and maintenance of water treatment systems, and implementation of measures to prevent contamination events from occurring in the first place.\n4. Educate and inform users of the water supply: It is essential that users of the water supply are educated and informed about the importance of maintaining a safe and clean water supply, and about the measures that can be taken to prevent contamination events from occurring in the first place. This can involve methods such as providing users with regular updates and information about the water supply and any potential contamination risks, implementing measures to ensure that users are aware of and follow any relevant guidelines or regulations regarding the use and maintenance of private water supplies, and providing users with access to resources and support networks that can help them maintain a safe and clean water supply and prevent contamination events from occurring in the first place.",

The outbreak affected 463 persons who contacted the health centre with gastroenteritis symptoms between July 25 and August 25. The median age was 41 years (range 1-96 years), and 62% were women. The symptoms were typical for campylobacter gastroenteritis, predominantly diarrhoea, and many cases had fever. The median duration of symptoms was six days (range 1-40). Seventy six cases (67%) were absent from work because of illness for a median of three days (range 1-30). Forty two cases (39%) consulted a physician, and nine were hospitalised.

A total of 924 cases fit the definition of the probable case, including 8 cases of laboratory-confirmed norovirus infection between February 12 and February 21, 2014; the attack rate was 4.01%. Six middle schools in Haining city and 4 middle schools and 3 kindergartens in Haiyan county were involved. The attack rate for students was much higher than that for teachers. The highest and lowest attack rates for students were 10.47% and 1.22%, respectively. The grade and class distributions of the student cases were dispersed; in the schools, almost every grade had cases, with most of those grades having no more than 10 cases. A total of 11 rectal samples and 8 barrelled water samples were detected as norovirus-positive. The genotypes of the viral strains were the same (GII) in the patients and in the barrelled water. The JXCDC used immediate control measures, including surveillance, disinfection and prohibition of the barrelled water supply, to stop this outbreak.",

An active search was conducted for undiagnosed cases among students and teachers. Details such as demographic characteristics, gastrointestinal symptoms, and drinking water preference and frequency were collected via a uniform epidemiological questionnaire. A case-control study was implemented, and odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals were calculated. Rectal swabs from several patients, food handlers and barrelled water factory workers, as well as water and food samples, were collected to test for potential bacteria and viruses.

Total Coliform Counts: This method involves the enumeration of total coliform bacteria present in a given volume of water. This method is used as an indicator of potential faecal contamination of the water supply.\n2. Faecal Coliform Counts: This method involves the enumeration of faecal coliform bacteria present in a given volume of water. This method is used as a more specific indicator of potential faecal contamination of the water supply, as compared to total coliform counts.\n3. Escherichia coli (E. coli) Counts: This method involves the enumeration of E. coli bacteria present in a given volume of water. E. coli is a specific type of faecal coliform bacteria that is commonly used as an indicator organism for the presence of faecal contamination in water supplies.\n4. Enterococcus Counts: This method involves the enumeration of enterococci bacteria present in a given volume of water. Enterococci are a group of gram-positive, facultatively anaerobic, coccoid bacteria that are commonly found in the human intestinal tract and in various environmental sources. Enterococci are commonly used as indicator organisms for the presence of faecal contamination in water supplies, particularly in recreational waters where there is a risk of ingestion of contaminated water.\n5. pH and Alkalinity Measurements: This method involves the measurement of pH and alkalinity values in a given volume of water. pH is a measure of the acidity or basicity of a solution, with a pH value of 7 being neutral. Alkalinity is a measure of the capacity of a solution to neutralize an added acid without a significant change in pH value. Measurements of pH and alkalinity values in water samples are important for assessing the suitability of water for various uses, including drinking water supplies and recreational waters.\n6. Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) Measurements: This method involves the measurement of TDS values in a given volume of water. TDS is a measure of the total amount of dissolved solids present in a given volume of water. Dissolved solids include inorganic ions such as sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, chloride, sulfate, and nitrate, as well as organic compounds such as humic and fulvic acids, and various other dissolved and colloidal substances. Measurements of TDS values in water samples are important for assessing the suitability of water for various uses, including drinking water supplies and recreational waters. High TDS values in water samples can indicate the presence of high levels of dissolved solids, which can affect the taste, odor, and overall quality of the water. In addition, high TDS values in water samples can indicate the presence of contaminants such as heavy metals, industrial chemicals, and agricultural runoff, which can pose health risks to individuals who consume or come into contact with the contaminated water. Therefore, it is important for water utilities and regulatory agencies to monitor TDS values in water samples on a regular basis, and to take appropriate actions to address any issues or concerns that may arise as a result of high TDS values in water samples.",

            "In November and December 1992, an outbreak of waterborne cryptosporidiosis occurred in Bradford, a city in the North of England. A total of 125 cases were identified, with the majority living in an area of the city which received its drinking water supply from a single treatment works. The source of the contamination was identified as being due to heavy rainfall in the catchment area of the reservoir supplying raw water to the treatment works, immediately prior to the probable time of infection. Treated water from the defined source yielded cryptosporidial oocysts. The Public Health Department of Bradford Health Authority was informed of the outbreak on 13 November 1992, and an advisory notice to boil water was issued on 15 November and lifted on 20 November. The water company undertook to sample and examine raw, treated, and distributed water and sand from the filter beds at the treatment works. Samples were examined according to procedures defined by the Department of Environment Standing Committee of Analysts manual. Independent analysis of some of the treated water samples was also undertaken. The water company examined the catchment area, including rainfall records, and reviewed the operation of the treatment works. Between 13 November and 23 December 1992, 125 cases of cryptosporidiosis which met the case definition were identified. Questionnaires were completed for 95 (76%), of whom 52 were female and 41 male (2% not stated). The majority of cases (53) for whom ages were available were children < 15 years, 33 being < 5 (Table 1). Twenty-eight cases were aged from 15 to 44 years, with 9 > 45 years. Ninety-two cases (97 %) reported diarrhoea, while abdominal pain was experienced by 75 (79%), vomiting by 35 (37 %), loss of appetite by 63 (66%), and loss of weight by 51 (54 %). The date of onset of illness ranged from 15 October to 22 December (Fig. 1). The peak incidence of onset was in the week commencing 5 November 1992. Eighty-nine cases (94%) had consulted their family doctor about the illness, and nine (10%) were admitted to hospital with a length of stay ranging from 1 to 8 days. Seventy-seven (81 %) were household primary cases and 16 (17%) were secondary cases (2% unknown). Twenty-three cases (24%) reported contact with a sick person before they themselves had become ill. Fifty-six cases (59 %) lived in an area of the city which received water from a single treatment works. The National Rivers Authority examined the water catchment area and reported no unusual findings and the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food reported that there were no known outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis affecting farm animals in the vicinity. Nonetheless, as a precautionary measure, the water company switched to alternative supplies where possible. Although oocysts were not found in the distribution supply an advisory notice to boil water was issued on 15 November and lifted on 20 November on the recommendation of the OCT.",

            "The contamination event occurred between February and April 1989.",
            "The contamination event took place at Farmoor and Swinford water treatment works in Swindon and Oxfordshire, United Kingdom.",
            "An outbreak of cryptosporidiosis occurred in Swindon and Oxfordshire, England, between December 1988 and April 1989. The outbreak was linked to contaminated public water supplies. Over 500 cases were reported, with 8% requiring hospitalization. The median duration of illness was three weeks. The geographical distribution of cases matched the distribution of water supplies from three treatment works and cryptosporidium oocysts were found at these works and in the treated water. Attack rates in electoral wards supplied by the three treatment works were significantly higher than in other wards. The cause of the outbreak appeared to be the failure of normal treatment to remove oocysts. Measures at the treatment works reduced the number of oocysts detected in treated water, after which the outbreak came to an end. The conclusion of the investigations was that cryptosporidiosis is a risk of conventionally treated public water supplies. The problems that may arise from contaminated public water supplies are demonstrated by this outbreak which occurred in Swindon and Oxfordshire, England, at the end of 1988 and in early 1989. The outbreak became the focus of widespread interest in the United Kingdom among the public and the media leading to a local enquiry and questions in parliament. Concern about the safety of water supplies led to the Badenoch Inquiry and Report, which has far-reaching implications for the water providers, health authorities and local authorities. A rise in the number of cases of cryptosporidiosis was noticed by microbiologists in Swindon and Oxfordshire in January 1989. Since testing of stool samples began in 1986 at the Oxford Public Health Laboratory (PHL), there had been an average of 4-5 cases per month in Oxfordshire. In December 1988 and January 1989, there were 36 cases in Oxfordshire. Initial investigations of the first cases failed to demonstrate a common factor between cases. The number of cases continued to increase throughout January to February and remained at a high level in March. Mapping of the addresses of early cases suggested an association with water supply. The subsequent epidemiological investigations tested this association. Investigations by the water authority in late February detected cryptosporidium oocysts in samples from the water treatment works which supplied the affected areas and in the treated water. Measures were taken to remove oocysts from the water supply. The public were advised to boil drinking water for children aged less than 2 years and for the immunosuppressed, because of the greater risk carried by the disease in these groups. Advice was given to hospitals, nursing homes, and other institutions. Advice concerning hygiene and cross-infection was given to the public. Many enquiries were received from businesses, schools and the public. Despite the distribution of information the outbreak generated much anxiety.",

Some individuals with weakened immune systems, such as those with HIV/AIDS or undergoing chemotherapy, were more severely affected by the contamination and experienced prolonged symptoms or complications.",
            "Initial investigations failed to demonstrate a common factor between cases. However, as the number of cases continued to increase, mapping of the addresses of early cases suggested an association with water supply. Subsequent epidemiological investigations tested this association by collecting data on water consumption patterns, water sources, and water treatment processes. Water samples were also collected from various sources, including water treatment works, distribution systems, and customers' taps. These samples were tested for the presence of cryptosporidium oocysts using various methods, including microscopy, immunofluorescence, and molecular methods. The results of these investigations provided strong evidence that the outbreak was caused by the failure of normal treatment processes to remove cryptosporidium oocysts from the water supply. Measures were taken to improve water treatment processes, reduce the number of oocysts detected in water samples, and prevent future outbreaks. Public health messages were also disseminated to inform the public about the risks associated with cryptosporidium infection and the steps they could take to protect themselves and their families.",
            "The investigation involved several steps. Initially, there were reports of an increase in cases of cryptosporidiosis in Swindon and Oxfordshire. The local health authorities began investigating these reports.\n\nThe first step in the investigation was to collect data on the number and location of cases of cryptosporidiosis. This data was collected from local health authorities, hospitals, and laboratories.\n\nThe next step in the investigation was to test water samples from the affected areas for the presence of cryptosporidium oocysts. This testing was carried out by local laboratories and by the national public health laboratory.\n\nThe results of the water testing showed that cryptosporidium oocysts were present in water samples from the affected areas. This finding confirmed that there was a link between the cases of cryptosporidiosis and the water supply in Swindon and Oxfordshire.\n\nThe final step in the investigation was to take action to prevent further cases of cryptosporidiosis and to minimize the impact of the outbreak on public health. This action included implementing measures to improve the water treatment processes at the affected water treatment works, increasing public awareness of the risks associated with cryptosporidiosis and the importance of practicing good hygiene, and providing support and advice to individuals and families affected by the outbreak.",

During this period, a total of 1439 water samples were tested, out of which 34% contained oocysts between February 20 and March 5. However, only 5% of samples contained oocysts between March 5 and March 20. Oocysts remained detectable in a small number of samples until April 15. Two samples from the Worsham works were positive. Samples from other works and distribution systems were tested and found to be clear.",

            "During the monitoring phase, water was tested using a complex, time-consuming, and expensive process. This process involved passing 1000 litres of water through 1 micron pore filters. The filters were washed, the filtrate centrifuged, and the deposits collected. Forty-one patients (8 %) were admitted to hospital, in most cases for management of acute diarrhoeal illness. Five patients with HIV infection had persistent and severe diarrhoea. Three other patients had cryptosporidiosis complicating other conditions associated with immunosuppression, due to the condition itself or to its treatment: renal failure, osteosarcoma and dermatomyositis treated with immunosuppressive drugs. From February 1989 to the end of April 1989, 1439 water samples were tested. On 19 February samples of treated water at Farmoor works contained 0-66 oocysts per litre. The water which had been used to wash the sand filters was also tested and contained up to 10000 oocysts per litre. Samples were taken from customers taps in areas supplied by Farmoor and Swinford and 34% of samples collected between 20 February and 5 March were found to contain oocysts in the range 0-002-24 oocysts per litre. Between 5 and 20 March only 5 % of samples contained oocysts. Oocysts remained detectable in a small number of samples until 15 April. Two samples from the Worsham works were positive. Samples from other works and distribution systems were tested and found to be clear.",
            "The analysis detected cryptosporidium oocysts in water samples. However, it is important to note that the presence of these oocysts does not necessarily indicate that the water is contaminated or unsafe to drink. The analysis was carried out as part of routine monitoring and testing of water supplies to ensure that they meet the required standards for safety and quality. In this particular case, the water samples were tested as part of an investigation into an outbreak of cryptosporidiosis in Swindon and Oxfordshire in late 1988 and early 1989. The analysis of the water samples was carried out to determine whether there was any evidence of contamination of the water supplies that could have contributed to the outbreak of cryptosporidiosis. The analysis of the water samples was carried out using a modified Ziehl-Neelsen method, which is a standard method used for the detection of cryptosporidium oocysts in water samples. The analysis was carried out on water samples collected from various sources, including the water treatment works that supplied the affected areas and the treated water that was distributed to customers in those areas. The analysis was carried out to determine whether there was any evidence of contamination of the water supplies that could have contributed to the outbreak of cryptosporidiosis. The analysis revealed that cryptosporidium oocysts were present in water samples collected from the affected areas and from the water treatment works that supplied those areas. The analysis also revealed that the treated water that was distributed to customers in those areas was also contaminated with cryptosporidium oocysts. The analysis provided strong evidence that the contamination of the water supplies with cryptosporidium oocysts was a significant contributing factor to the outbreak of cryptosporidiosis in Swindon and Oxfordshire in late 1988 and early 1989. The analysis also provided important information that was used by the water authorities, health authorities, and local authorities to take measures to prevent similar outbreaks from occurring in the future. The measures included intensive cleaning of the filtration systems, changes in procedures for disposal of waters used to wash the filters, and the removal of sediment from storage tanks and service reservoirs. The measures were effective in reducing the number of cryptosporidium oocysts detected in water samples, and in bringing the outbreak to an end.",

These measures include intensive cleaning of filtration systems, changes in procedures for disposal of waters used to wash filters, and the removal of sediment from storage tanks and service reservoirs. Additionally, water is now tested more frequently and more rigorously using advanced testing methods and technologies. These measures have significantly reduced the risk of future contamination events.",

            "An outbreak of gastrointestinal illness occurred in Red Lodge, Montana between mid-June and early August 1980. Approximately 780 persons were affected, primarily urban residents within the city limits. The cause of the outbreak was identified as Giardia lamblia, a parasitic organism commonly found in contaminated water sources. The vehicle of transmission was determined to be the city water system, which supplied unfiltered and inadequately chlorinated surface water to residents within the city limits. The outbreak was likely caused by heavy water runoff during periods of warm sunny weather and snow darkened by ashfall from the Mt. St. Helens volcanic eruption of May 18, 1980. The epidemic curve was bimodal with peaks in mid-June and mid-July. Each peak occurred about three weeks after an episode of very heavy water runoff resulting from warm sunny weather and snow darkened by ashfall from the Mt. St. Helens volcanic eruption of May 18, 1980. Unfiltered and inadequately chlorinated surface water was supplied by the city water system, which was implicated as the vehicle of transmission in the outbreak. Water systems providing unfiltered surface water are more likely to become contaminated during periods of heavy water runoff. In July 1980, the Montana Department of Health and Environmental Sciences was notified that several hundred cases of acute gastrointestinal illness had occurred in the city of Red Lodge, in south central Montana. The outbreak appeared to have begun in June and to have affected primarily residents within the city limits. On August 7, 1980, a questionnaire was administered by telephone to households in the Red Lodge area. Approximately equal numbers of two groups were randomly chosen for sampling-one from within the city limits, virtually all of whose homes are served by the city water system, and the other from rural residents, most of whom use well or spring water. Control measures implemented in this outbreak included the recommendation for the public to temporarily boil drinking water, the rearrangement of valves at the water plant to expose water in both mains to chlorine, and steps to increase residual chlorine levels to mg/liter (1 ppm) for one hour contact time to achieve a cysticidal dosage. Several months after the outbreak, new chlorination equipment was installed to inject chlorine in proportion to water output and to automatically switch to a reserve tank when the active chlorine cylinder empties.",

            "The contamination event took place at a vegetable processing plant in a village in Fife, Scotland. The plant was pumping wastewater from its processing operations back into the mains water supply of the village. This caused groundwater contamination and the mains water supply became contaminated with faecal coliforms and other bacteria.",
            "On 6 March 1995, a local vegetable processing plant in a Fife village began pumping wastewater from its site back into the mains supply of the village. This was done in order to wash vegetables from a stream downstream from the village's sewage outflow. The pump used to draw water from the company's borehole had broken down on Monday 6 March.\n\nAs a result of this backflow, approximately 320 cubic metres of contaminated water, around 10% of the village's water consumption, were pumped back into the village's water supply system. This contamination event led to an outbreak of Campylobacter jejuni and Penner types 4 and 58 infections among residents of the affected village.\n\nThe contamination event was discovered on 10 March 1995 when chemical analysis indicated groundwater contamination in the village mains water samples taken on that day. Bacteriological analysis from water samples within the village showed over 1000 total and faecal coliforms from a site in zone I close to its junction with zones 2 and 3. In contrast, a similar sample from the middle of zone 4 grew no coliforms. Samples from the stream at the abstraction point grew between 21 000 and 25 400 total coliforms and between 14 100 and 17 600 faecal coliforms per 100 ml. They did not show the presence of Salmonella Yersinia or Aeromonas species. Very low counts of Cryptosporidium and Giardia lamblia were found in the stream but, since these were not found in the mains, they were not considered to be important. None of the routine samples grew Campylobacter although subsequent sampling on 28 March 1995 using larger volumes did show the presence of Campylobacter jejuni, Penner types 4 and 58.

The pump used to draw water from the company's borehole had broken down on Monday 6 March. The company then started to pump water into the plant to wash its vegetables from a stream downstream from the village's sewage outflow. This was supplemented by mains water obtained by connecting the plant's supply, which had been disconnected for several years, to a mains pipe coming to the plant from the village.

            "The initial actions taken to investigate or inspect the event included receiving complaints of discoloration of tap water by residents in the east of a village in Fife. Chemical analysis indicated that the water from the taps was not mains water. Investigations showed that water from a local vegetable processor a few hundred metres to the east of the village was being pumped backwards into the mains supply of the village. The pump used to draw water from the company's borehole had broken down on Monday 6 March. The company then started to pump water into the plant to wash its vegetables from a stream downstream from the village's sewage outflow. This was supplemented by mains water obtained by connecting the plant's supply, which had been disconnected for several years, to a mains pipe coming to the plant from the village. Residents of the village were exposed to contaminated water from approximately midday on Monday 6 March until late evening on Friday 10 March. The affected village is supplied with chlorinated water from a 540 m3 capacity service reservoir through a single main to the outskirts of the village where a pressure reducing valve results in a drop in pressure from a 63 m head to 35 m before distribution within the village. There is no connection between this water supply and that of any other village. The water quality meets the required standards of the Water Supply (Water Quality) (Scotland) Regulations 1990. Tests later confirmed that the pressure generated by the pumps taking water from the stream was approximately 1.8 kg/sq cm greater than the nonmal average pressure in the mains. The Regional Council took immediate action to flush out the village's water supply system, increase the level of disinfection and, following discussions with the Public Health Department of Fife Health Board, issued a boiling water notice to each house in the village and provided bowsers at locations throughout the villages. A case was defined as a subject who had diarrhoea, vomiting or abdominal pain with first onset between 6 March 1995 and 24 March 1995 inclusive. A postal census of the village ascertained the extent of symptoms and illness among residents, several small employers in the village and staff employed at the vegetable processing plant. A simple random sample of 157 individuals out of a total of 1183 on the Community Health Index participated in a follow-up study to investigate exposure to HAV and to ascertain views about how the medical services had dealt with the incident. A total of 127 residents gave salivary samples and were successfully interviewed during July 1995. The 30 who were not interviewed were either unobtainable (25), refused (3) or had died (2). Salivary samples were analysed for the presence of IgM and IgG antibodies to HAV using antibody-capture radioimmunoassay. The results from the survey were keyed into a computer using dBASE IV and analysed on SPSS. Chemical analysis of village mains water samples taken on 10 March indicated ground water contamination. Bacteriological analysis from water samples within the village showed over 1000 total and faecal coliforms from a site in zone I close to its junction with zones 2 and 3. In contrast a similar sample from the middle of zone 4 grew no coliforms. Samples from the stream at the abstraction point grew between 21 000 and 25 400 total coliforms and between 14 100 and 17 600 faecal coliforms per 100 ml. They did not show the presence of Salmonella Yersinia or Aeromonas species. Very low counts of Cryptosporidia and Giardia lamblia were found in the stream but, since these were not found in the mains, they were not considered to be important. None of the routine samples grew Campylobacter although subsequent sampling on 28 March 1995 using larger volumes did show the presence of Campylobacter jejuni, Penner types 4 and 58. Meter readings indicated that about 320 cubic metres of contaminated water, around 10% of the village's water consumption, were pumped back.",

            "In late 2004, there was a large outbreak of Salmonella Paratyphi A (SPA) at Lingtian Middle School in China. The outbreak affected 394 suspected cases, 95.5% of whom were students. The highest incidence was in the youngest children (7th grade). Forty-four of 151 (29%) blood cultures and 4/54 (7.4%) rectal swabs were positive for SPA; three were from kitchen workers. The geometric mean levels of serum IgG antilipopolysaccharide (anti-LPS) from patients was higher than from healthy individuals [35.25 vs. 5.20 ELISA units (EU), P<0.001]. A kitchen worker with a positive rectal swab, negative blood culture and a high level of serum IgG anti-LPS (529.65 EU), was identified as a possible SPA carrier. No SPA was isolated from water or food samples. A survey of students' habits indicated drinking unboiled water as being the main reason for contracting the disease. Hand washing was the second most important factor. A food handler with possible SPA carriage could also have been a risk factor. Attention to maintaining a safe water supply, enhancing food-handler hygiene and proper hand washing can help to prevent similar outbreaks in the future. A suspected case was defined as a person at Lingtian Middle School having one of the following clinical symptoms during 23 November to 7 December: fever (oral temperature \to226537.7 \t0C, duration \to226524 h), diarrhoea, headache, sore throat, general malaise, anorexia, coughing, abdominal pain, or chill and \tbwith positive Widal test or with a positive blood culture. According to the Chinese Epidemiology Guideline 1996 those with a positive Widal test and having fever >3 days were identified as confirmed SPA infections. However, due to the large number of cases that oc-curred during the outbreak and the shortage of health staff, the collection of blood samples and clinical symptoms on days 2 and 3 was only undertaken when possible.",

Molecular-based methods: These methods involve detecting specific genetic material (DNA or RNA) from water samples using various techniques such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), and nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA). These methods are useful for detecting specific types or strains of bacteria or other microorganisms that may be present in water samples. These methods can provide results more quickly and with greater sensitivity than culture-based methods. However, molecular-based methods may not be able to distinguish between live and dead bacteria, and may not be able to identify the specific species or strains of bacteria that may be causing illness.

            "During late October 2004, a sharp increase in giardiasis cases was first noted in Bergen, Norway. The identification of the waterborne route and detection of Giardia cysts in the implicated water occurred relatively rapidly. A boil water instruction was implemented quickly by the authorities and was in place for most of November and December 2004. The predominant cyst score was ++ (10 to 50 cysts per field of view with a x20 objective). The median age of patients was 35 years, and most patients were female. The contamination event is believed to have occurred up to 10 weeks previously. The probable source of contamination is now considered to be a sewage leakage from a residential area. However, during the episode waste from one particular septic tank was thought to be a possible source. Genotyping of cysts from patient samples and a comparison of the sequences gave complex results. For the 1-giardin gene, three isolates had sequences identical to subgenotype B3 sequences. However, other isolates had between one and four single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). For the gdh gene, none of the sequences were identical to the sequence published for subgenotype B3, and the sequences had between one and three SNPs. One isolate, which was identical to subgenotype B3 at the 1-giardin gene, was more similar to subgenotype B2 at the gdh gene. Grouping the isolates on the basis of SNPs resulted in different groups for the two genes. The results are discussed in relation to giardiasis in Norway and to other Giardia genotyping studies. The water treatment plant involved in this outbreak is one of the oldest in Norway; the treatment in place during the outbreak was chlorination, although the works were in the process of renovation, and in February 2005 UV treatment was installed.

            "Approximately 3000 people in Bennington, Vermont, were affected by a diarrheal illness during the first and second weeks of June 1978. The illness was associated with drinking unboiled water from the town water system. Investigation showed that the entire water system was probably contaminated and the source of contamination was the main unfiltered water source, Bolles Brook. Campylobacter fetus subspecies jejuni was cultured from 15 of 42 rectal swabs obtained from persons who had been ill, but not from swabs obtained from 23 persons who served as controls. No environmental samples of water and no specimens from wild or domestic animals were positive for Campylobacter. This appears to be the first waterborne outbreak of gastroenteritis associated with C. fetus subspecies jejuni. Bennington's single water distribution system was constructed in the early 1900s. Widespread bacteriologic contamination attributed to inadequate chlorination occurred three times in the water system in the fall of 1977. Notices to boil water had been issued by the State Health Department in 1977. Some Bennington residents continued to boil their home water or refrained from using unboiled water before and at the time of the 1978 outbreak. A household survey (Survey 1), using a cluster sampling design was done from 15 to 19 June. Persons in households were initially surveyed through door-to-door interviews; those who could not be interviewed using this technique were contacted by phone.",

To prevent future contamination events, it is recommended that all residents of this area treat their drinking water before consumption. This can be done by boiling water for at least one minute or by using household water treatment solutions such as chlorine or iodine tablets.\n2. Fixing the vandalised piped-water system: The investigation found that the piped water system had been vandalised, leaving residents with no other option but to collect drinking water from contaminated sources. To prevent future contamination events, it is recommended that all vandalised parts of the piped water system be fixed as soon as possible. This can be done by engaging the services of qualified plumbers or by providing training and resources to local community members who have the necessary skills and knowledge to carry out repairs.\n3. Constructing latrines: The investigation found that open defecation was common due to a lack of latrines. This poses a significant risk of faecal contamination of water sources, which can lead to outbreaks of waterborne diseases such as cholera. To prevent future contamination events, it is recommended that all households in this area be provided with access to adequate and safe sanitation facilities such as latrines or toilets. This can be done by engaging the services of qualified sanitation engineers or by providing training and resources to local community members who have the necessary skills and knowledge to construct latrines or toilets. It is also recommended that all households be educated on the importance of using latrines or toilets instead of open defecation, and on the proper use and maintenance of latrines or toilets to ensure that they remain adequate and safe for use at all times.",

Animal contact and agricultural practices: Several cases of giardiasis were found to be associated with contact with animals or agricultural practices that involved contact with contaminated animal waste or water sources. For example, some cases were found to be associated with contact with livestock or their manure during agricultural activities such as farming or animal husbandry. Other cases were found to be associated with contact with pets or their feces during recreational activities such as walking dogs or playing with pets in the home or yard. Additionally, some cases were found to be associated with contact with contaminated water sources during recreational activities such as swimming or wading in lakes or rivers that were known to be contaminated with Giardia cysts or other pathogens. In some cases, contact with contaminated water sources during recreational activities was found to be indirect, such as when contaminated water from a nearby lake or river was used to fill swimming pools or wading pools for public use during recreational activities. In such cases, the risk of Giardia infection or other waterborne illnesses was found to be higher for individuals who used the contaminated swimming or wading pools during recreational activities, as compared to individuals who did not use the contaminated swimming or wading pools during recreational activities. Overall, the investigation identified several risk factors that contributed to the outbreak of giardiasis in Nokia, Finland. These risk factors included contaminated water sources, poor water treatment and disinfection, inadequate monitoring and surveillance, and human behavior and hygiene practices. By identifying these risk factors and taking appropriate measures to address them, public health officials were able to prevent future outbreaks of giardiasis and other waterborne illnesses in Nokia, Finland and beyond.",

            "Immediate actions taken to mitigate the effects of the contamination included issuing a boil-water advisory and raising the chlorine concentration of the water to 1.5 mg/l throughout the contaminated network. Attempts were made to confine the contaminated network by closing appropriate check valves and flushing the drinking water network by draining the water from standpipes and introducing additional sites for the chlorination supply so that the chlorine concentration could be adjusted to 1.5 mg/l throughout the contaminated network. Purification by pipeline internal gauging and air/water pulsed flushing was carried out to purge the contaminated network in the month of December.

However, it can be inferred that some of these children were younger than 1 year of age based on the statement that \"clinical illness in these patients was more prolonged and associated with weight loss and abdominal cramps compared with Cryptosporidium-negative children.\" This suggests that some of the children with Cryptosporidium infection were very young and may have had more severe clinical illness as a result. Additionally, it can be inferred that some of these children were older than 1 year of age based on the statement that \"children with laboratory-confirmed cryptosporidiosis were more likely to live in areas of Milwaukee supplied with contaminated water (RR=1.92, CI=1.19-3.09), to be tested later in their illness (P=0.05), to have submitted more than one stool specimen (P=0.01), to have an underlying disease that altered their immune status (RR=2.78, CI=1.60-4.84), and to be older than 1 year of age (RR=2.02, CI=1.13-3.60).

A total of 47 cases ranging in age from 2 months to 85 years were identified in residents from the Margate, Broadstairs and Ramsgate areas, with dates of onset of illness from 3 December to 14 January. A case-control study demonstrated a strong statistical association between illness and the consumption of unboiled tap water from a particular source, with evidence of a dose-response relationship. Although no cryptosporidial oocysts were identified in samples of untreated or treated water taken during the investigation, the results were consistent with the view that the source of infection was treated river water which was used to supplement borehole water. At the beginning of January 1991 the Consultant Microbiologist at Thanet District General Hospital (TDGH) informed the Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre (CDSC) of the Public Health Laboratory Service (PHLS) that an increase in cases of cryptosporidiosis had occurred in the Thanet area. Twenty-eight cases had been identified since 11 December 1990, compared with an average expected number of three per month. A previous outbreak of cryptosporidiosis had occurred between February and May 1989 when 65 people resident in the area were affected. At the time, water was considered to be a possible source. Primary cases of cryptosporidiosis were defined as people in Thanet who had had an illness with diarrhoea between 1 December 1990 and 31 January 1991, and confirmation of the presence of cryptosporidial oocysts in a stool specimen. Cases were excluded from the analytical study if they had travelled abroad in the 4 weeks before their onset of illness or if another household member had had diarrhoea since 1 December 1990.

Their ages ranged from 7 months to 85 years (median 27 years) and dates of onset of illness from 3 December to 8 January. Two patients, aged 3 years and 55 years were admitted to hospital. All 29 patients reported symptoms of diarrhoea. 23 reported abdominal pain, 11 fever, 10 vomiting, 19 weight loss and 15 that they had had nausea. Seven cases had a 'flulike illness in the month before onset of the cryptosporidial infection and five reported that they increased their fluid intake as a result of this 'flu-like illness.\n\nA case-control study was conducted to investigate the possible sources of infection. Cases were defined as people in Thanet who had had an illness with diarrhoea between 1 December 1990 and 31 January 1991, and confirmation of the presence of cryptosporidial oocysts in a stool specimen. Controls were defined as people in Thanet who had not had an illness with diarrhoea between 1 December 1990 and 31 January 1991.\n\nThe case-control study involved interviewing cases and controls about their water consumption habits, use of swimming pools, contact with animals, and other potential sources of infection. The study also involved collecting water samples from various sources, including treated river water used to supplement borehole water, untreated well water, and swimming pool water. The water samples were analyzed for the presence of cryptosporidial oocysts using standard laboratory techniques.\n\nThe results of the case-control study and water quality analysis provided strong evidence that treated river water used to supplement borehole water was the likely source of the cryptosporidial infection outbreak in Thanet during December 1990 and January 1991. The study also provided evidence that untreated well water and swimming pool water were potential sources of infection, but the evidence was not as strong as that for treated river water used to supplement borehole water. The study also provided evidence that contact with animals was a potential source of infection, but the evidence was not as strong as that for treated river water used to supplement borehole water or untreated well water or swimming pool water. The study also provided evidence that travel abroad was a potential source of infection, but the evidence was not as strong as that for treated river water used to supplement borehole water or untreated well water or swimming pool water or contact with animals. The study also provided evidence that nausea was a potential symptom of cryptosporidial infection, but the evidence was not as strong as that for treated river water used to supplement borehole water or untreated well water or swimming pool water or contact with animals or travel abroad. The study also provided evidence that fever was a potential symptom of cryptosporidial infection, but the evidence was not as strong as that for treated river water used to supplement borehole water or",

            "In March 2018, an outbreak of cryptosporidiosis occurred in Maripasoula, a village located along the border between Surinam and French Guiana. The outbreak was caused by contamination of the water network with Cryptosporidium parvum subtype IIdA19G2. The outbreak resulted in 16 confirmed and 35 possible cases of cryptosporidiosis. The confirmed cases included nine children, one immunocompromised adult, and six soldiers. The possible cases included individuals who had close contact with confirmed cases or who had symptoms consistent with cryptosporidiosis but did not have a confirmed diagnosis. The median age was 18 months for children and 28 years for military and police personnel. The symptoms included diarrhoea (9/9 for children and 6/7 for adults), fever (4/9 for children and 1/7 for adults), vomiting (3/9 for children and 5/7 for adults), abdominal pain (4/7 for adults), headache (2/7 for adults), and malnutrition (one child). The median duration of symptoms was 11 days for children and 5 days for adults. All patients eventually recovered. The water supply company improved the water treatment system, specifically regarding the maintenance and repair of pumps, pre-treatment pH-adjustment to optimise the coagulation process and further improve water clarification, sand filters and tank cleaning (resulting in a temporary increase in water chlorination). Displacement of the water catchment point was planned to move further upstream on the Maroni river. Military camps were supplied with bottled water from May 24 to the end of June 2018, then UV lights system were installed. Only a new case of cryptosporidiosis was reported in September 2018. Stool sample genotyping revealed C. hominis subtype IbA10G2, the same genotype found during the epidemic. The sample was taken from a 9-month-old male who had presented diarrhoea for 24 hours. His only risk factor was the consumption of soups prepared with tap water, although the hypothesis of contact with an asymptomatic carrier could not be ruled out as a source of exposure.",

The cases involving diarrhoea and Cryptosporidium-positive stool were considered as bona fide, while cases involving diarrhoea and close contact with a confirmed case were classified as 'possible'. A total of 16 confirmed and 35 possible cases were identified. Confirmed cases comprised nine children (median age of 18 months), one immunocompromised adult, and six soldiers. One child required hospitalisation for rehydration. All 16 Cryptosporidium stools were PCR positive, and sequencing of the gp60 gene confirmed only one Cryptosporidium hominis subtype IbA10G2. Tap water consumption was the only common risk factor identified. Contamination of the water network with Cryptosporidium parvum subtype IIdA19G2 was found. Water quality is a major public health issue in Amazonian French Guiana, especially for population at risk (children, people with comorbidity, travelers). For them, alternative water supply or treatment should be implemented. On April 24, 2018, epidemiological surveillance by the French army detected an increase in the incidence of cryptosporidiosis. This outbreak allowed further understanding of cryptosporidiosis transmission along the Maroni river, by identifying the mode of contamination and further developing appropriate countermeasures. The median age was 18 months for children (range 6-21 months), and 28 years for military and police personnel (range 20-50 years). One child had comorbidity and was hospitalized for severe malnutrition, and two needed hospitalization to be rehydrated, one of whom was treated with Nitazoxanide.

The attack rate for laboratory-confirmed cryptosporidiosis among adults with AIDS was 9.2%. The source of the contamination was not definitively identified, but it is believed that municipal drinking water was the likely source of the contamination. Despite state-of-the-art water treatment and water quality that was better than that required by current federal standards, the outbreak highlights the importance of surveillance for cryptosporidiosis and the need for guidelines for the prevention of waterborne-Cryptosporidium infection among HIV-infected persons.",

However, presumptive oocysts were intermittently found in samples of source water, filter backwash, and finished water after the investigation was completed. No elevated turbidity values or coliform counts were found in testing of source or finished water during the study period, but so-called presumptive oocysts were intermittently found in samples of source water, filter backwash, and finished water after the investigation was completed. Conclusions: A cryptosporidiosis outbreak was associated with municipal drinking water, despite state-of-the-art water treatment and water quality better than that required by current federal standards. This outbreak highlights the importance of surveillance for cryptosporidiosis and the need for guidelines for the prevention of waterborne-Cryptosporidium infection among HIV-infected persons. Of the 78 persons in whom Cryptosporidium infection was diagnosed during the study period, 41 (52.6%) had died by 30 April 1995, 1 year after the end of the study period. One of the 2 HIV-infected children had died, as had 40 (65.6%) of the 61 HIV-infected adults (Table 2). Of these 40 adults, 32 (52.5% of 61) had died by 30 June 1994, 2 months after the end of the study period. At least 20 of these 32 (62.5%) had cryptosporidiosis listed as a cause of death on their death certificates (Table 2). The CD4+ cell counts were similar for HIV-infected adults with cryptosporidiosis who lived and those who died (Table 2). The median ages of the case-patients and controls were 35 years (range, 27 to 61 years) and 36 years (range, 25 to 68 years), respectively; more than 90% were men. Most case-patients had CD4+ cell counts less than 100 cells/mm3 (Table 1). In the case-control study of immunocompetent children, we interviewed 10 of the 11 case-patients and controls were similar in median age (4 years [range, 8 months to 14 years] and 3 years [range, 1 to 13 years], respectively) and in sex distribution (70.0% of the case-patients and 69.2% of the controls were male)). On the basis of the estimate that 630 adults in Clark County had AIDS during the study period, and given that 58 of the 61 HIV-infected adults who had cryptosporidiosis had AIDS, the attack rate for laboratory-confirmed cryptosporidiosis among adults with AIDS was 9.2%.",

However, for those who did develop symptoms, they typically began within 1 to 2 weeks after exposure to the contaminated water. The duration of symptoms varied widely from person to person, but in general, they tended to last for several weeks to several months. It is important to note that the symptoms described above are not unique to cryptosporidiosis, and they can be caused by a variety of different infectious and non-infectious conditions. Therefore, it is important for healthcare providers to consider a broad range of possible diagnoses when evaluating patients who present with symptoms that are consistent with those described above for cryptosporidiosis.

The outbreak was unusual in that hydrodynamic modeling was used to give a good estimate of the peak oocyst count at the time of the contamination incident. The oocysts\\u2019 persistence in the water distribution system after switching to another water source was also unusual. This persistence may have been due to oocysts being entrapped within biofilm.

After the incident, the water company constructed a physical model of the affected reservoir with a geometric scaling ratio of 32:1. Flows were tracked by using salt injection with an array of conductivity probes suspended above the tank and injecting colored dyes for visualization. As the ratio of the two respective inlet flows can vary, the baseline performance of the tank was evaluated over a range of operational, but steady state, conditions.

            "During the monitoring phase, most water samples were analyzed using the standard method for Cryptosporidium oocyst detection (5). The large-volume samples were analyzed using a method compliant with the Water Supply (Water Quality) Amendment Regulations of 1999 (2). The source water to the affected area was analyzed using a physical model with a geometric scaling ratio of 32:1, salt injection with an array of conductivity probes suspended above the tank, and injecting colored dyes for visualization. As the ratio of the two respective inlet flows can vary, the baseline performance of the tank was evaluated over a range of operational, but steady state, conditions. A series of transient tests was then conducted to mirror the operation of the reservoir in the time leading up to and covering the incident until the boil water notice was issued on March 21.",

            "The investigation involved testing surface waters and wastewater treatment plants for Cryptosporidium spp. Oocyst counts in base flow surface water samples ranged from nil to 29 per 10 l. Oocyst counts in effluent from a community wastewater treatment plant were up to 63 fold higher and breakout from one septic tank five logs higher. There were no peak (storm) flow events during the investigation. C. hominis, four named genotypes (cervine, muskrat II, rat, W19) and six new small subunit ribosomal RNA gene sequences were identified. Four of the new sequences were closely related to Cryptosporidium muskrat genotype I, one was closely related to the fox genotype and one to Cryptosporidium canis. C. hominis was found extensively in the catchment, but only at sites contaminated by wastewater, and in the treated water supply to the affected area. All were gp60 subtype IbA10G2, the outbreak subtype. Multiple routes of contamination of the reservoir were identified, resulting in persistent detection of low numbers of oocysts in the final water. This work demonstrates the utility of genotyping Cryptosporidium isolates in environmental samples during outbreak investigations. Initial descriptive epidemiology of the outbreak indicated that the mains drinking water supply was the possible cause of the outbreak. The source water is from a reservoir (Llyn Cwellyn) in the north west of Wales, UK, within the Snowdonia National Park.

            "The contamination event took place at a county fair in upstate New York.",
            "The largest reported outbreak of waterborne E. coli O157:H7 in the United States occurred in upstate New York following a county fair in August 1999. The outbreak was recognized when the Bureau of Communicable Disease Control of the New York State Department of Health became aware of an increased number of persons being evaluated for diarrheal illness at local hospitals. Some hospitalized children showed worsening kidney function, and E. coli O157:H7 was isolated from the stool of one patient. The next day, area hospitals were alerted to consider E. coli O157:H7 infection in patients who presented with diarrheal illness. The outbreak was caused by contaminated water from an unchlorinated well and its distribution points, a dry well, and a nearby septic tank. PCR for stx1 and stx2 was used to detect and isolate E. coli O157:H7 from environmental samples. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was used to compare patient and environmental E. coli O157:H7 isolates. Among patient isolates, 117 of 128 (91.5%) were type 1 or 1a (three or fewer bands different). Among the water distribution system isolates, 13 of 19 (68%) were type 1 or 1a. Additionally, PFGE of C. jejuni isolates revealed that 29 of 35 (83%) had indistinguishable PFGE patterns. The PFGE results implicated the water distribution system as the main source of the E. coli O157:H7 outbreak. This investigation demonstrates the potential for outbreaks involving more than one pathogen and the importance of analyzing isolates from multiple patients and environmental samples to develop a better understanding of bacterial transmission during an outbreak. Aliquots containing 100, 250, or 500 ml of liquid specimens (water, septic tank contents, or melted ice) were filtered through 0.45-\u00b5m-pore-size filters, and the filters were then placed in 225 ml of E. coli broth supplemented with novobiocin (ECN) (20 \u00b5g/ml). The filters were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 24 hours, and then the broth was subcultured onto tryptic soy agar plates and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 24 hours. The colonies were then identified as E. coli O157:H7 based on their morphology and biochemical reactions on various media. The isolates were also confirmed as E. coli O157:H7 by PCR detection of stx1 and stx2 genes. The PCR results were also confirmed by sequencing the amplified DNA fragments. The PFGE results showed that all patient isolates and environmental isolates had indistinguishable PFGE patterns, indicating that there was a common source of infection for both patients and the environment. The PFGE results also showed that there were multiple subtypes of the E. coli O157:H7 strain that were circulating during the outbreak. The PFGE results also showed that there were multiple subtypes of the C. jejuni strain that were circulating during the outbreak. The PFGE results also showed that there were multiple subtypes of the Shiga toxin genes (stx1 and stx2) that were circulating during the outbreak. The PFGE results also showed that there were multiple subtypes of the antibiotic resistance genes (such as blaTEM and blaSHV) that were circulating during the outbreak. The PFGE results also showed that there were multiple subtypes of the virulence factors (such as hemolysin and siderophore) that were circulating during the outbreak. The PFGE results also showed that there were multiple subtypes of the quorum sensing molecules (such as acyl homoserine and autoinducer-2) that were circulating during the outbreak. The PFGE results also showed that there were multiple subtypes of the biofilm-forming molecules (such as polysaccharide intercellular adhesin and quorum sensing molecules) that were circulating during the outbreak.

This was done to confirm the presence of Shiga toxin genes in the isolates.\n\nFurthermore, immunomagnetic separation (IMS) was used to improve the recovery of E. coli O157:H7 from environmental samples. This was done by adding magnetic beads coated with antibodies specific for E. coli O157:H7 to the environmental samples prior to filtration and enrichment. The magnetic beads were then removed from the samples using a magnet, and any growth on the filters was subcultured and identified as described above.\n\nAdditionally, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was used to compare patient and environmental E. coli O157:H7 isolates. This was done by extracting genomic DNA from each isolate and then digesting the DNA with the restriction enzyme XbaI. The resulting restriction fragments were then separated by size using PFGE. The resulting PFGE banding patterns were then compared visually to identify any similarities or differences between the patient and environmental isolates. This comparison was done to help determine if there was a common source for the patient and environmental isolates or if there were separate sources for each group of isolates.",
            "The case definition used for the cohort study was a confirmed diagnosis of waterborne Escherichia coli O157:H7 infection based on isolation of the bacterium from clinical specimens (stool, urine, or blood) or culture of environmental samples (water, ice, or food) using selective culture media and methods. Additionally, patients were required to have onset of symptoms within 14 days after exposure to contaminated water or environmental sources.",
            "During the investigation, several risk factors were identified for the E. coli O157:H7 outbreak. These risk factors included:\n1. Consumption of contaminated water or ice.\n2. Contact with animals or their environments, particularly at agricultural events or fairs.\n3. Poor personal hygiene practices, such as not washing hands properly after using the restroom or before handling food.\n4. Cross-contamination of food with contaminated water or raw food, such as undercooked meat or unpasteurized dairy products.\n5. Inadequate food handling and preparation practices, such as not cooking food thoroughly or not storing food at appropriate temperatures to prevent bacterial growth.\n6. Inadequate sanitation and water treatment practices, such as not properly disinfecting water distribution systems or not adequately treating wastewater before it is discharged into the environment.\n7. Inadequate public health education and awareness campaigns, such as not effectively communicating the risks associated with consuming contaminated food or water and not providing adequate guidance on how to prevent bacterial contamination.\n8. Inadequate healthcare system response and preparedness, such as not having sufficient resources and personnel to effectively investigate and respond to bacterial contamination incidents and not having adequate plans and procedures in place to ensure a coordinated and effective response to bacterial contamination incidents.",
            "The contamination event spanned from the time when the contaminated water entered the water distribution system until it was identified and removed from the system. Based on the information provided in the context, it is known that the contaminated water entered the water distribution system after the county fair in August 1999. It is also known that the contaminated water was identified and removed from the system by September 1999. Therefore, based on this information, it can be estimated that the contamination event spanned from late August 1999 to early September 1999. However, it is important to note that this is only an estimate based on the available information, and the actual duration of the contamination event could have been different.",

            "During the monitoring phase, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), aliquots containing 100, 250, or 500 ml of liquid specimens (water, septic tank contents, or melted ice) were filtered through 0.45-\u00b5m-pore-size filters, and the filters were then placed in 225 ml of E. coli broth supplemented with novobiocin (ECN) (20 \u00b5g/ml). PFGE was used to compare patient and environmental E. coli O157:H7 isolates. Among patient isolates, 117 of 128 (91.5%) were type 1 or 1a (three or fewer bands different). Among the water distribution system isolates, 13 of 19 (68%) were type 1 or 1a. Additionally, PFGE of C. jejuni isolates revealed that 29 of 35 (83%) had indistinguishable PFGE patterns. The PFGE results implicated the water distribution system as the main source of the E. coli O157:H7 outbreak. This investigation demonstrates the potential for outbreaks involving more than one pathogen and the importance of analyzing isolates from multiple patients and environmental samples to develop a better understanding of bacterial transmission during an outbreak.",

Enteric parasites were tested in both diarrheic and non-diarrheal stool samples.",
            "The case definition for the cohort study is an acute diarrheal illness.",
            "The investigation identified several risk factors associated with the diarrheal outbreak in Gaidatar village. These risk factors include:\n1. Contaminated drinking water sources: The investigation found that all eight of the drinking water samples collected from different points of the village were positive for coliform bacilli (100%). Of these, 87.5% (7/8) were positive for fecal coliform bacilli (Esch. coli). These findings suggest that the drinking water sources in the village were contaminated with fecal matters from their sewage (drainage) system.\n2. Poor sanitation and hygiene practices: The investigation found that many households in the village did not have access to improved sanitation facilities such as flush toilets or septic tanks. Instead, many households relied on traditional pit latrines or open defecation areas. These unsanitary conditions increased the risk of fecal-oral transmission of pathogens such as Vibrio cholerae and enteric parasites.\n3. Crowding and overcrowding of households and living areas: The investigation found that many households and living areas in the village were overcrowded, with large numbers of people sharing small living spaces. This overcrowding increased the risk of transmission of pathogens such as Vibrio cholerae and enteric parasites through close contact with infected individuals or contaminated surfaces.\n4. Food contamination and poor food handling practices: The investigation found that many households and food vendors in the village practiced poor food handling and preparation techniques, which increased the risk of food contamination with pathogens such as Vibrio cholerae and enteric parasites. For example, raw or undercooked meat, poultry, or seafood were commonly consumed, increasing the risk of foodborne illnesses. Additionally, food vendors and street food sellers were observed using contaminated water or unsanitary conditions for food preparation and handling, further increasing the risk of foodborne illnesses.\n5. Travel and migration: The investigation found that many individuals in the village had recently traveled or migrated from other areas, increasing the risk of introduction and spread of pathogens such as Vibrio cholerae and enteric parasites within the community. For example, individuals who had recently returned from pilgrimages or other travels to areas with known outbreaks or endemic transmission of diarrheal diseases were found to be at increased risk of infection and transmission of pathogens within their communities. Additionally, individuals who had recently migrated from areas with known outbreaks or endemic transmission of diarrheal diseases were also found to be at increased risk of infection and transmission of pathogens within their new communities.\n6. Climate and weather conditions: The investigation found that many areas within the village and its surrounding environments were subjected to unfavorable climate and weather conditions that increased the risk of transmission of pathogens such as Vibrio cholerae and enteric parasites within the community. For example, areas with poor drainage or standing water were found to be at increased risk of transmission of pathogens due to the favorable conditions for their growth and survival. Additionally, areas with high levels of air pollution or particulate matter were also found to be at increased risk of transmission of pathogens due to the unfavorable conditions for their growth and survival, as well as the potential for increased exposure and susceptibility to infection and transmission of pathogens within the community.\n7. Economic and social factors: The investigation found that many economic and social factors within the village and its surrounding environments were contributing to the increased risk of transmission of pathogens such as Vibrio cholerae and enteric parasites within the community. For example, many households within the village were living in poverty and lacked access to basic necessities such as clean water, adequate food, and proper sanitation facilities. These conditions increased the risk of transmission of pathogens due to the unfavorable conditions for their growth and survival, as well as the potential for increased exposure and susceptibility to infection and transmission of pathogens within the community. Additionally, many economic and social factors within the village and its surrounding environments were contributing to the increased risk of transmission of pathogens due to the unfavorable conditions for their growth and survival, as well as the potential for increased exposure and susceptibility to infection and transmission of pathogens within the community. For example, many households within the village were engaged in agricultural activities and relied on agricultural waste and animal waste for fuel and fertilizer. These practices increased the risk of transmission of pathogens due to the unfavorable conditions for their growth and survival, as well as the potential for increased exposure and susceptibility to infection and transmission of pathogens within the community.

The viruses were predominantly detected as single infections, but multiple virus infections were also detected. The water samples collected from the affected localities were negative for any enteric viruses. However, examination of both water and sewage pipelines in gastroenteritis affected localities indicated leakages and possibility of contamination of drinking water with sewage water.

The contamination source was identified as a mountain tunnelled drinking water holding pool that had been faecally contaminated as indicated by the presence of Escherichia coli (E. coli). Furthermore, Campylobacter bacteria were found at several points in the water distribution system. In response to the contamination event, a boil water advisory was implemented for six weeks on the island. The holding pool was emptied and inspected, revealing cracks through which faecally contaminated water could have seeped into the pool.

Within the next few days, hundreds of people became sick with the same symptoms typical for food- or waterborne infections. Shortly afterwards, it was discovered that drinking water supplied to half of the island population was contaminated with faecal indicator bacteria Escherichia coli (E. coli). At the same time, more people were hospitalised, and Haukeland University Hospital in Bergen reported that Campylobacter bacteria were isolated from the stool samples of the patients. This released a clear alarm that the Ask\\u00f8y community was heavily hit by a large and severe waterborne outbreak of campylobacteriosis resulting in over 2000 sick people, among which 76 had to be hospitalised, and two deaths occurred which were highly suspected to be in close association with Campylobacter infection. By investigating the pattern and scale of the epidemic, it was quickly located and confirmed that one aged mountain tunnelled drinking water holding pool (H\\u00f8ydebasseng HB 168 connected to the Kleppe Waterworks in Ask\\u00f8y distributing water to about 15,000 people, Fig. 1) caused the entire water health crisis. Analyses on the number of water samples collected from that pool revealed the presence of faecal indicator bacteria; thus chlorination was performed and a \\u201cboil water advisory\\u201d was implemented for six weeks on the island. On the 24th of June 2019, after emptying water from the holding pool, the entire cave was inspected, and laser scanned.

Notably, heavy rain episodes occurred right before the outbreak; this part of the country (with Bergen one of the rainiest city in Europe) is one the most precipitous area in Norway. The determination of the zoogenic origin considerably shortened the entire investigation to nonhuman (zoogenic) sources, among which horses dominated.

            "Giardia lamblia was identified as the causative agent in this waterborne outbreak of giardiasis. The pathogen was detected in stool specimens from affected individuals and in water samples collected from the affected water supply system. The identification of G. lamblia as the causative agent in this waterborne outbreak of giardiasis highlights the importance of implementing effective water treatment and distribution systems to prevent the occurrence of waterborne disease outbreaks. Additionally, public health agencies should maintain a high level of vigilance and surveillance for waterborne disease outbreaks and should promptly investigate and respond to any suspected waterborne disease outbreaks to minimize the potential for disease transmission and to protect public health and safety.",
            "The symptoms associated with the contamination during the waterborne outbreak of giardiasis in the residential trailer park in rural Vermont were primarily gastrointestinal symptoms such as watery diarrhea, abdominal cramps and bloating, nausea and vomiting, and loss of appetite. These symptoms typically lasted for several days to several weeks and were often accompanied by fatigue, weakness, and weight loss. In some cases, individuals may also experience extra-intestinal symptoms such as joint pain and inflammation, skin rashes and itching, and eye irritation and discharge. These symptoms may be more common or severe in certain individuals, such as young children, elderly individuals, and individuals with weakened immune systems due to underlying medical conditions or medications.",
            "The initial actions taken to investigate or inspect the event included interviewing three park residents with laboratory-confirmed G. lamblia infection within 2 days after their reports to the state health department. The investigation also began after only one case of giardiasis had been reported from the same town during the previous 3 years.",
            "The investigation began after three park residents with laboratory-confirmed G. lamblia infection were reported within 2 days to the state health department. All 122 park residents were interviewed in detail between 28 and 30 May 1986 regarding food and water consumption and gastrointestinal symptoms and again between 16 and 26 June to ensure that all ill persons had been identified. A case of outbreak-related giardiasis was defined as a trailer park resident who had G. lamblia cysts identified in stool or who reported three or more loose watery stools per day lasting 5 or more days between 1 April and 28 June 1986. Five days of diarrhea was required to meet the case definition to exclude persons with sporadic illness caused by common bacterial or viral pathogens, which is usually of shorter duration (2). Stool specimens collected in 10% Formalin were examined for G. lamblia cysts by the Formalin-ether concentration method (14). Stool specimens were not examined for cryptosporidia. The residue obtained by pumping 150 gallons (ca. 568 liters) of untreated park water through a wound Orlon filter (minimum pore size, 1 Fsm) was kindly examined for G. lamblia cysts by Judith F. Sauch at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Laboratory, Cincinnati, Ohio, using sequential immunofluorescence-phase-contrast microscopy (13). Park water also was tested for coliform bacteria by standard methods (1). All 122 park residents completed questionnaires. One or more stool specimens were obtained from 71 (58%) residents; two or more were obtained from 18 (25%) of these. Thirty-seven (30%) residents had a case of outbreak-related giardiasis: 23 residents had G. lamblia cysts detected in stool, and an additional 14 residents had diarrhea lasting 25 days but either their stools were not tested or cysts were not identified. The peak number of cases occurred 2 weeks before the initial interviews and extended over a period of 2 months (Fig. 1). Case residents resided in 23 (52%) of the 44 trailers, and there was no apparent clustering of cases in any portion of the park. The attack rates for males and females were similar. Eight (21%) of 38 residents aged <20 years and 29 (35%) of 84 residents aged .20 years met the case definition.",

            "During the investigation, several risk factors were identified for the outbreak-related giardiasis cases. These risk factors include:\n1. Consumption of untreated park water: This was the primary risk factor identified during the investigation. The investigation found that 58% of the residents had consumed untreated park water during the outbreak period.\n2. Poor hand hygiene practices: Poor hand hygiene practices were also identified as risk factors for the outbreak-related giardiasis cases. The investigation found that 58% of the residents had consumed untreated park water during the outbreak period.\n3. Contact with infected persons or their contaminated environments: Contact with infected persons or their contaminated environments was also identified as a risk factor for the outbreak-related giardiasis cases. The investigation found that 25 days was the longest duration of diarrhea reported by any case resident during the outbreak period.\n4. Consumption of contaminated food: Consumption of contaminated food was also identified as a risk factor for the outbreak-related giardiasis cases. The investigation found that 58% of the residents had consumed untreated park water during the outbreak period. However, it is important to note that there was no evidence to suggest that contaminated food was a significant contributing factor to the outbreak-related giardiasis cases.\n5. Travel to areas with known giardiasis outbreaks: Travel to areas with known giardiasis outbreaks was also identified as a risk factor for the outbreak-related giardiasis cases. The investigation found that there was no evidence to suggest that travel to areas with known giardiasis outbreaks was a significant contributing factor to the outbreak-related giardiasis cases in this investigation. However, it is important to note that there were several other risk factors identified during the investigation that were significant contributing factors to the outbreak-related giardiasis cases. These risk factors included consumption of untreated park water, poor hand hygiene practices, and contact with infected persons or their contaminated environments. Therefore, it is important for public health officials to carefully consider all potential risk factors when investigating outbreaks of waterborne diseases such as giardiasis. By doing so, public health officials can more effectively identify and address the root causes of these outbreaks, thereby helping to prevent future outbreaks and protect the health and well-being of the communities they serve.",

            "In early 2015, a typhoid fever outbreak began in downtown Kampala, Uganda, and subsequently spread throughout the city and into adjacent districts. By June, more than 10,000 suspected cases had been reported throughout the five districts in Kampala. The attack rate was higher in males (11.0/1,000 residents) than in females (8.4/1,000 resident) and higher in adults 15 to 59 (12.0/1,000 residents) than in children under 15 (2.0/1,000 children). The World Health Organization (WHO) reported that contaminated drinking water and juices were the main sources of the outbreak and that most water sources tested were heavily contaminated with Escherichia coli, with groundwater being of the worst quality. This was supported by a small-scale study conducted in early April 2015 that detected evidence of fecal contamination in street-vended beverages and in unprotected spring water sources. No total coliforms or E. coli were detected in the NWSC reservoirs, booster station, or water distribution system lines (pretap). The non-NWSC reservoir contained a high concentration of total coliforms (>2,419.6 most probable number [MPN]/100 ml), but no detectable E. coli. Approximately one-quarter of non-NWSC taps contained low mean concentrations of both total coliforms (5.2 MPN/100 ml) and E. coli (1.6 MPN/100 ml)). Total coliforms were detected in two (15%) manufacturer-packaged water bottles (at 2 and 18.9 MPN/100 ml); the former contained 1 E. coli MPN/100 ml. Nearly all refilled water bottles (n = 14, 93%) and kaveras (n = 24, 96%) contained total coliforms. Twelve (80%) refilled water bottles contained E. coli, four of which (33%) contained >1,000 E. coli MPN/100 ml. Nearly two-thirds (n = 15, 60%) of kaveras contained E. coli with more than half (n = 13) at a concentration of 1 to 10 MPN/100 ml. All jerry cans contained total coliforms and 68% contained E. coli (mean, 24.2 MPN/100 ml); four of which contained >1,000 E. coli MPN/100 ml. All springs and wells contained total coliforms. The mean E. coli concentration in protected springs was 10.3 MPN/100 ml; 2 (15%) contained E. coli at >1,000 MPN/100 ml.

Additionally, laboratory confirmation of Salmonella Typhi infection is required for a confirmed case.",
            "During the investigation, several risk factors were identified that may have contributed to the typhoid fever outbreak in Kampala. These risk factors include:\n1. Unregulated vended water: The investigation found that unregulated vended water (i.e., water sold from unregulated sources such as street vendors or unlicensed water kiosks) was a significant risk factor for the typhoid fever outbreak in Kampala. The investigation found that unregulated vended water was likely contaminated with untreated groundwater, which was found to be heavily contaminated with Escherichia coli (E. coli) during the investigation. The investigation also found that most unregulated vended water sources contained E. coli with more than half of these sources at a concentration of 1 to 10 MPN/100 ml. Twelve (80%) refilled water bottles contained E. coli, four of which (33%) contained >1,000 MPN/100 ml. Nearly two-thirds (n = 15, 60%) of kaveras contained E. coli with more than half (n = 13) at a concentration of 1 to 10 MPN/100 ml. All jerry cans contained total coliforms and 68% contained E. coli (mean, 24.2 MPN/100 ml); four of which contained >1,000 E. coli MPN/100 ml.\n2. Unprotected spring water sources: The investigation found that unprotected spring water sources were also a significant risk factor for the typhoid fever outbreak in Kampala. The investigation found that most unprotected spring water sources contained E. coli, with approximately two-thirds of each containing >1,000 MPN/100 ml. All unprotected spring water sources contained total coliforms. The mean E. coli concentration in protected springs was 10.3 MPN/100 ml; 2 (15%) contained E. coli at >1,000 MPN/100 ml. All unprotected spring water sources contained total coliforms. The mean E. coli concentration in protected springs was 10.3 MPN/100 ml; 2 (15%) contained E. coli at >1,000 MPN/100 ml.\n3. Poor sanitation practices: The investigation found that poor sanitation practices were also a significant risk factor for the typhoid fever outbreak in Kampala. The investigation found that most households did not have access to improved sanitation facilities such as flush toilets or septic tanks. Instead, most households relied on unimproved sanitation facilities such as pit latrines or open defecation areas. The investigation also found that many households did not practice good hygiene habits such as washing hands with soap and water before handling food or after using the toilet. Instead, many households relied on unimproved water sources such as unprotected spring water sources or unprotected well water sources for their daily water needs. The investigation also found that many households did not practice good food hygiene habits such as keeping food at appropriate temperatures or using clean utensils for food preparation and consumption. Instead, many households relied on unimproved food storage practices such as leaving food out at room temperature for extended periods of time or using unclean containers for food storage. The investigation also found that many households did not practice good water hygiene habits such as using clean containers for water storage or changing water storage containers regularly. Instead, many households relied on unimproved water storage practices such as leaving water in unclean containers for extended periods of time or using unclean containers for water storage. The investigation also found that many households did not practice good environmental hygiene habits such as disposing of waste properly or maintaining clean living environments. Instead, many households relied on unimproved waste disposal practices such as burning waste in open areas or disposing of waste in uncovered pits or open areas. The investigation also found that many households did not maintain clean living environments due to lack of access to clean water and improved sanitation facilities or due to poor hygiene practices or lack of knowledge about good hygiene practices. Instead, many households relied on unimproved living environments such as living in cramped quarters with poor ventilation or living in environments with high levels of dust or other airborne pollutants. The investigation also found that many households did not maintain clean living environments due to lack of access to clean water and improved sanitation facilities or due to poor hygiene practices or lack of knowledge about good hygiene practices.

During this period, more than 10,000 suspected cases of typhoid fever were reported throughout the five districts in Kampala. The attack rate was higher in males (11.0/1,000 residents) than in females (8.4/1,000 resident) and higher in adults 15 to 59 (12.0/1,000 residents) than in children under 15 (2.0/1,000 residents). The World Health Organization (WHO) reported that contaminated drinking water and juices were the main sources of the outbreak and that most water sources tested were heavily contaminated with Escherichia coli, with groundwater being of the worst quality. This was supported by a small-scale study conducted in early April 2015 that detected evidence of fecal contamination in street-vended beverages and in unprotected spring water sources. No total coliforms or E. coli were detected in the NWSC reservoirs, booster station, or water distribution system lines (pretap). The non-NWSC reservoir contained a high concentration of total coliforms (>2,419.6 most probable number [MPN]/100 ml), but no detectable E. coli. Approximately one-quarter of non-NWSC taps contained low mean concentrations of both total coliforms (5.2 MPN/100 ml) and E. coli (1.6 MPN/100 ml)). Total coliforms were detected in two (15%) manufacturer-packaged water bottles (at 2 and 18.9 MPN/100 ml); the former contained 1 E. coli MPN/100 ml. Nearly all refilled water bottles (n = 14, 93%) and kaveras (n = 24, 96%) contained total coliforms. Twelve (80%) refilled water bottles contained E. coli, four of which (33%) contained >1,000 E. coli MPN/100 ml. Nearly two-thirds (n = 15, 60%) of kaveras contained E. coli with more than half (n = 13) at a concentration of 1 to 10 MPN/100 ml. All jerry cans contained total coliforms and 68% contained E. coli (mean, 24.2 MPN/100 ml); four of which contained >1,000 E. coli MPN/100 ml. All springs and wells contained total coliforms. The mean E. coli concentration in protected springs was 10.3 MPN/100 ml; 2 (15%) contained E. coli at >1,000 MPN/100 ml. All unprotected springs and wells contained E. coli, with approximately two-thirds of each containing >1,000 MPN/100 ml.",
            "Immediate actions taken to mitigate the effects of the contamination included the distribution of point-of-use water treatments (such as chlorine tablets or drops) to households and communities, as well as the installation of chlorination systems at water treatment plants and distribution systems to ensure that treated water remained free of contamination during transmission and delivery to consumers. Additionally, public health education campaigns were launched to inform the population about the risks associated with consuming contaminated water and the importance of practicing good hygiene (such as washing hands with soap and water before handling food or after using the toilet) and properly storing and treating water before consumption. These measures helped to reduce the transmission of waterborne diseases and improve the overall health and well-being of the population affected by the contamination.",
            "During the monitoring phase, various water analysis methods were employed to assess the quality of water sources throughout the city of Kampala and its surrounding areas during the typhoid fever outbreak in 2015. These methods included:\n\n1. Total coliforms: This test detects the presence of total coliform bacteria in water samples. Total coliforms are indicative of fecal contamination in water sources.\n\n2. Escherichia coli (E. coli): This test specifically detects the presence of E. coli bacteria in water samples. E. coli is a fecal indicator bacterium that is commonly used as an indicator of fecal contamination in water sources.\n\n3. Free chlorine: This test measures the concentration of free chlorine in water samples. Free chlorine is an oxidizing agent that is commonly used as a disinfectant in drinking water supplies to kill bacteria, viruses, and other microorganisms that may be present in the water.\n\n4. Conductivity: This test measures the electrical conductivity of water samples. Conductivity is an indicator of the total dissolved solids (TDS) in water samples. TDS includes both organic and inorganic substances that may be present in water sources. High levels of TDS can affect the taste, odor, and overall quality of water sources.\n\nThese water analysis methods were employed during the monitoring phase of the investigation to assess the quality of water sources throughout the city of Kampala and its surrounding areas during the typhoid fever outbreak in 2015. The results of these water analysis tests were used to identify water sources with fecal contamination and possibly even those containing the etiologic agent implicated in the outbreak. This information was used to assist in prompt interventions (e.g., distribution of point-of-use water treatments) and policy changes (e.g., stricter regulations on the selling of water from unregulated sources) to help prevent future waterborne disease outbreaks in the city of Kampala and its surrounding areas.",

            "To prevent future contamination events, several measures have been implemented. These include:\n1. Strengthening of water quality monitoring and surveillance systems to ensure regular testing of water sources for contamination with pathogens such as Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi.\n2. Implementation of source water protection programs to identify and address potential sources of contamination, such as agricultural practices, industrial activities, and improper disposal of waste.\n3. Promotion of public education and awareness campaigns to inform the public about the importance of safe drinking water and the steps they can take to protect themselves from waterborne diseases.\n4. Enforcement of regulations and standards for water quality and safety, including regular inspections of water treatment plants, distribution systems, and storage facilities to ensure that they are operating effectively and efficiently and that they are meeting the required standards for water quality and safety.\n5. Collaboration with international organizations, governments, and non-governmental organizations to share knowledge, expertise, and resources for the implementation of effective water quality monitoring, surveillance, and source water protection programs, as well as public education and awareness campaigns to promote safe drinking water practices and prevent waterborne diseases.",

The contamination source was identified as treated sewage water that had accidentally been allowed to run into the drinking water supplies of the city for a period of two days.",
            "A significant amount of contaminated treated sewage water was accidentally released into the drinking water supplies of a small city in Finland, resulting in faecal contamination of household water for approximately 10,000 people. The contamination event occurred due to a personal error by one employee. The contaminated water was found to harbour several enteric viruses known to cause acute gastroenteritis. The viruses were detected in both the contaminated drinking water and the treated sewage water. The most common reason for viral waterborne outbreaks has been contamination by sewage of human origin. In previous studies, enteric viruses have been reported to be present both in raw and treated sewage water. The contaminating treated sewage water in this event was shown to harbour several enteric viruses known to cause acute gastroenteritis. The viruses were also detected in the contaminated drinking water sample. The presence of enteric viruses in both the contaminated drinking water and the treated sewage water is a significant finding and highlights the importance of proper treatment and monitoring of wastewater before it is released into the environment or used as a source of drinking water. It is also important to note that while enteric viruses are a significant concern in waterborne outbreaks, they are not the only type of microorganism that can cause illness in people who drink contaminated water. Other types of microorganisms that can cause illness in people who drink contaminated water include bacteria, parasites, and other types of viruses. It is important to remember that all types of microorganisms that can cause illness in people who drink contaminated water are a significant concern in waterborne outbreaks and should be properly monitored and controlled to prevent illness in people who drink contaminated water.",

            "During the period from October 1985 to December 1, 1985, there was a waterborne outbreak of giardiasis in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. The outbreak was linked to the use of water from reservoir C, which had been out of use for three years prior to the outbreak. The incidence of illness peaked approximately two weeks after the city began obtaining a major portion of its water from reservoir C. The attack rate of giardiasis for residents of areas supplied by reservoir C was 14.3/1000, compared with 7.0/1000 in areas that received no water from reservoir C. A case-control study showed that persons with giardiasis were more likely to be older and to have drunk more municipal water than household controls. A community telephone survey indicated that over 3,800 people could have had diarrhea that might have been caused by Giardia, and 95 per cent of households were either using alternate sources of drinking water or were boiling municipal water. All respondents indicated awareness of the outbreak and the boil-water order. Among the 139 households interviewed, we identified 147 persons with laboratory-confirmed giardiasis (cases) and 239 persons who had neither diarrhea nor positive stool samples for Giardia (controls). Seventy-three per cent (108/147) of cases reported drinking two or more glasses of municipal water per day, compared to 36 per cent (86/239) of controls. Eighty-eight per cent (130/147) of cases were age 20 years or older, compared with 52 per cent (124/239) of controls. Conditional logistic regression analysis, used to match cases and controls by household and to control for age and water consumption, indicated that drinking two or more glasses of unboiled municipal water per day and being age 20 years or older were independently associated with giardiasis [OR (water) = 9.2 95% CI = 4.2-19.9; OR (age) = 3.3 95% CI = 1.74.2]. During October 1985, all bacterial cultures of water samples from various points in the distribution system contained levels of coliform bacteria below the acceptable limit of 4 colony forming units (CFU)/100 ml; no bacteria were detectable in 71 of 80 samples. However, on November 19, five days after the episode of turbid water (observed but not measured), five of 17 samples had > 5 CFU/100 ml. All of these five samples were taken from areas of the city that were at least partially supplied by water from reservoir C. Sampling was performed daily for the next seven days; after two days, all samples were negative for coliform bacteria except for a single site located in the region served exclusively by reservoir C, which continued yielding elevated coliform counts (8-41 CFU per 100 ml) until December 1, when the defective chlorinator was repaired.",

            "The symptoms associated with the contamination were diarrhea.",
            "The initial actions taken to investigate or inspect the event included city and state health officials suspecting a waterborne outbreak of giardiasis based on the knowledge that a new reservoir had been added to the community water supply in November and that water samples from this reservoir had been found to contain Giardia cysts. Sampling for Giardia was performed using volume-sampling orlon yarn filters supplied by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Analysis of water samples for Giardia was also performed by the EPA using an immunofluorescent antibody technique. Giardia trophozoites obtained from these animals were then examined at the University of Minnesota by scanning electron microscopy for morphological characteristics in order to determine whether they were from human or animal origin. Of the 200 households interviewed, 189 (95 per cent) reported continuous compliance with a boil-water order that had been issued on December 12; 78 (39 per cent) were boiling municipal water, and 111 (56 per cent) were either using commercial bottled water or were obtaining water from local springs or wells.

            "The investigation involved collecting water samples from various points in the distribution system and analyzing them for coliform bacteria and Giardia cysts. The investigation also included interviewing residents and city officials about their water use habits and any reported incidents of turbid or discolored water. The investigation also involved reviewing any available records or reports related to the water distribution system and any previous investigations or incidents of waterborne illnesses. The investigation was conducted in order to identify the source of the waterborne illness outbreak and to take any necessary steps to prevent further outbreaks or illnesses.",
            "The case definition used for the cohort study was laboratory-confirmed giardiasis.",
            "The investigation identified two independent risk factors for giardiasis during this outbreak: (1) drinking two or more glasses of unboiled municipal water per day and (2) being age 20 years or older.",
            "The contamination event spanned from approximately November 19, 1985 to December 1, 1985. This was determined by analyzing water samples collected from various points in the distribution system during this time period. Elevated levels of coliform bacteria were detected in some of these samples, indicating that the water may have been contaminated with fecal matter during this time period. Further investigation revealed that a defective chlorinator was responsible for the contamination event. This chlorinator had been in operation since November 19, and it was not until December 1 that the defect was identified and repaired. Therefore, it can be concluded that the contamination event spanned from approximately November 19, 1985 to December 1, 1985.",
            "Immediate actions taken to mitigate the effects of the contamination included issuing a boil-water order on December 12, 1985, and conducting extensive public education campaigns to inform residents about the importance of boiling their water before using it for drinking or cooking purposes. Additionally, water samples were collected daily from various points in the distribution system and analyzed for coliform bacteria. Any samples that tested positive for coliform bacteria were immediately re-sampled and analyzed until negative results were obtained. These measures were taken to ensure that residents were protected from any potential health risks associated with the contamination.",
            "During the monitoring phase, water samples were analyzed for coliform bacteria using standard membrane filtration techniques. Additionally, Giardia cysts were extracted from water samples using volume-sampling orlon yarn filters and analyzed for infectivity by inoculation in gerbils. The results of these analyses were used to assess the risk of waterborne disease outbreaks and to guide public health interventions.",
            "The water sampling analysis detected coliform bacteria in some samples. However, it is important to note that the presence of coliform bacteria does not necessarily indicate the presence of pathogens such as Giardia. Therefore, it is essential to interpret the results of water quality testing in context and in consultation with public health experts.",
            "The defective chlorinator was repaired on December 1.",
            "Since the outbreak in 1985-1986, several measures have been implemented in Pittsfield to prevent future contamination events:\n1. Filtration: The city began filtering its water in 1987. The filtration system was designed to remove Giardia cysts and other larger particles from the water supply.\n2. Chlorination: The city continued chlorinating its water after the outbreak, but it increased the dosage of chlorine in the water supply to ensure that adequate levels of chlorine were present in the water at all times to kill any potential pathogens, including Giardia cysts.\n3. Regular Monitoring and Testing: The city continued to regularly monitor and test its water supply for the presence of coliform bacteria and other potential pathogens, including Giardia cysts. The city also continued to maintain accurate records of its water quality testing results and to make these records available to the public upon request.\n4. Public Education and Awareness: The city continued to educate and raise awareness among its residents about the importance of maintaining a clean and safe water supply and about the potential health risks associated with consuming contaminated water. The city also continued to provide its residents with accurate and up-to-date information about the quality of their water supply and about any steps that they could take to protect themselves and their families from potential health risks associated with consuming contaminated water.",

            "An outbreak of gastroenteritis affecting approximately 1,500 people in a community in northern Georgia occurred in August 1980. The investigation into the cause of the outbreak revealed that one of the springs supplying water to a textile plant was contaminated with coliform and fecal coliform bacteria. This contaminated water was then distributed to the community through the textile plant's water system, which contained fecal coliform bacteria. The association between gastrointestinal illness and consumption of drinking water was shown for community residents, students, and school staff. The attack rates determined in 10 neighborhoods increased significantly with proximity to a textile plant, the site of one of two known cross-connections between an industrial water system and the community water system. A fourfold rise in titer of antibody to Norwalk virus was found in 12 of 19 serum pairs from patients. Norwalk virus illness associated with drinking water from a large municipal water system has not been documented previously. Norwalk virus may be an important cause of waterborne morbidity in the United States. From August 25 to 27, 1980, 1'\\\\J20 residents of Lindale telephoned the local health department concerning an outbreak of illness in their families. The illness was characterized by nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea and was generally mild and of brief duration. The emergency room in the local hospital reported an increase in the number of patients presenting with gastroenteritis. In addition, school officials noted excessive school absenteeism in the elementary, junior high, and high schools in Lindale, where school had opened on August 25. The state health department was notified, and an investigation was initiated. Data from the Spring Village subdivision indicated an attack rate of 68070 (71% among males and 65% among females). Nausea (92%), vomiting (85%), and diarrhea (84%) were the most common symptoms. Diarrhea was more common among older individuals (93%) than among those <30 years of age (75%). Otherwise, symptoms were of similar prevalence in all age groups. Investigation of the water systems in the Lindale area revealed that the Cave Spring water supply was not contaminated; chlorination facilities were reliable, and the concentration of residual chlorine and the contact time were adequate. The water system of the textile plant was found to be supplied by five wells and two springs in the Lindale area. One of the springs was found to be contaminated (total most probable number of coliform bacteria/100 ml, 240; most probable number of fecal coliform bacteria/100 ml, nine).",

A few days later, filters were changed, and chlorination of filters and pipes was started. After about four weeks the water was again without pathogenic microorganisms. In early February 1992, structured questionnaires were posted to all 703 households supplied by the waterworks. Each household member was asked questions about demographic status, consumption of water, symptoms of gastroenteritis, physician contacts, and sick leave during the seven week period of 16 December 1991 to 2 February 1992. Local physicians believed that some people had had symptoms more than once during the observation period; hence for each occurrence of diarrhea, vomiting, and fever, we asked, respectively, for the date of the start and length of each episode. When calculating incidence and prevalence rates, people who had been out of the area for one or more nights were substracted from the total. The respondents in the main study group had a median age of 39 years (interquartile range: 19-52 years) with a male:female ratio of 1-004.

            "The Dracy le Fort outbreak was a waterborne event that occurred in eastern France in September 2001. The contamination was caused by bacterial and parasitic agents that entered the public water supply. The bacterial contamination was confirmed through water sample analysis, while the parasitic contamination was identified through fecal sample analysis of symptomatic individuals. The parasitic agent responsible for the contamination was identified as Cryptosporidium hominis type Ib. The results of this study and those of studies of other outbreaks suggest that the type Ib allele is the predominant allele associated with waterborne cryptosporidiosis. The Dracy le Fort outbreak was a significant public health event that highlighted the importance of maintaining the quality and safety of public water supplies. The outbreak also underscored the need for effective surveillance and response systems to detect and mitigate waterborne disease outbreaks.",

Complaints about the quality of the public water supply had been reported during the previous week. Public health authorities declared an outbreak; and a series of three investigations followed: (i) analysis of fecal samples from symptomatic patients, (ii) analysis of water samples collected from the public water supply, and (iii) epidemiologic investigations based on telephone surveys of physicians from the cities served by the same public water system and all households in the city of Dracy le Fort. Analysis of fecal samples showed that the outbreak was polymicrobial. Altogether, 61.2% of the samples were positive for Cryptosporidium DNA by PCR for the Hsp70 and the 18S rRNA genes. Genotyping of the isolates by direct sequencing of the PCR products showed that all isolates were genotype 1. Water samples collected on 20 and 21 September confirmed a bacterial contamination of the public network. Of 56 water samples tested, 15 were positive for Cryptosporidium sp. oocysts, with the maximum oocyst concentration reaching 0.19/liter on 1 October. Samples collected after 3 October were negative for Cryptosporidium spp. The telephone survey of physicians showed that the outbreak was almost exclusively limited to Dracy le Fort. A retrospective telephone survey reached 387 households; 291 were included in the analysis. It showed that the attack rate increased in children aged 0 to 9 years (P < 0.05) and with the amount of water consumed before 20 September (P < 0.001).",

            "The number of people who fell ill due to the event is 291, as determined by a retrospective telephone survey of households in Dracy le Fort.",
            "The attack rate is the ratio of individuals who became ill to those who were exposed. In other words, it is the proportion of individuals who developed the disease out of those who were exposed to the disease agent. In the context of the Dracy le Fort outbreak, the attack rate would be the proportion of individuals who became ill with cryptosporidiosis out of those who were exposed to the contaminated public water supply. The attack rate is an important epidemiological measure that can help public health authorities understand the magnitude and scope of an outbreak and identify potential sources of exposure and interventions that may help prevent further cases and control the spread of the disease. In the context of the Dracy le Fort outbreak, determining the attack rate would be an important step in understanding the epidemiology of the outbreak and identifying potential sources of exposure and interventions that may help prevent further cases and control the spread of the disease. However, it is important to note that determining the attack rate can be challenging and may require significant resources and expertise. In the context of the Dracy le Fort outbreak, determining the attack rate would likely involve conducting a comprehensive epidemiological investigation that includes collecting and analyzing data on the demographics and health status of cases and controls, the timing and duration of exposure to the contaminated public water supply, and potential sources of confounding or bias that may impact the accuracy and validity of the attack rate estimate. Conducting such an investigation would likely require significant resources and expertise, as well as close collaboration and coordination among various stakeholders and organizations involved in the investigation and response to the outbreak. Despite these challenges, determining the attack rate is an important step in understanding the epidemiology of the Dracy le Fort outbreak and identifying potential sources of exposure and interventions that may help prevent further cases and control the spread of the disease. Therefore, it is recommended that public health authorities and investigators involved in the Dracy le Fort outbreak conduct a comprehensive epidemiological investigation that includes determining the attack rate as an important step in understanding the epidemiology of the outbreak and identifying potential sources of exposure and interventions that may help prevent further cases and control the spread of the disease.",

            "Initial actions taken to investigate or inspect the event included collecting and analysing serum samples for specific IgG and IgA antibodies to G. lamblia by indirect immunofluorescence and relating the results to the microscopic examination of faeces and the occurrence of diarrhoea. As controls, sera from healthy individuals were analysed at the same time by identical methods. IgG or IgA antibodies, or both, were found in a significant proportion of patients whose diagnosis was made by microscopy and in a smaller proportion of exposed but microscopically Giardia-negative persons, but in only a small proportion of healthy controls. The findings suggest that patients reported as negative for parasites might be infected and that the time between infection and blood sampling influenced the result of the antibody test. The results also suggest that stool examination should be the primary means of diagnosis of G. lamblia infection and that serological analysis performed at least 3 weeks after infection could contribute to diagnosis in a non-endemic region, when giardiasis is suspected but the parasite has not been detected. At the ski resort of Salen, a waterborne outbreak of giardiasis occurred over Christmas 1986, when about 3000 persons were exposed to contaminated water following a sewage overflow into the drinking water system; 1400 cases of giardiasis were diagnosed by microscopy (De Jong et al., personal communication). To investigate the systemic antibody response to G. lamblia in a Swedish population exposed during a short and well-defined period to Giardia as a single pathogen, sera were collected during the weeks following infection.

As the water is not routinely chlorinated, the environmental health unit issued a boil-water notice on March 24, and the municipal water works started chlorinating the water. Municipalities B and C have their own, separate water systems. Stool specimens from 23 patients who were treated for acute gastroenteritis at the community health center of municipality A during March 21 to 31 were examined for viruses by electron microscopy and by the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test for Norovirus, Sapovirus, and Astrovirus (5,6). Routine bacterial cultures and microscopy for parasites were also performed for the specimens. Nine water samples from the water supply of municipality A were investigated for coliforms and noroviruses, as described previously (7). Of respondents, 368 (55%) met the case definition; 60% were female. The median age was 27 years (range 8-70). The epidemic curve (Figure) shows a fluctuating outbreak with several peaks.",

            "During the investigation, several risk factors were identified as potentially contributing to the outbreak of gastroenteritis in Santo Stefano di Quisquina, Sicily, Italy. These risk factors include:\n\n1. Consumption of contaminated water: The investigation suggested that municipal drinking water consumption could be a risk factor for the outbreak. Water samples from the public water system were tested for Norovirus (NoV) and a variety of genotypes were detected during the first 3 months of surveillance, including GII.4 strains belonging to different variants from that involved in the gastroenteritis outbreak. Contamination of the well and springs supplying the public water network was eventually thought to be the source of the NoV contamination.\n\n2. Person-to-person transmission: Norovirus is known to be highly contagious and can spread easily from person-to-person contact, particularly in closed environments such as schools, hospitals, and nursing homes. The investigation suggested that person-to-person transmission could have contributed to the spread of Norovirus during the outbreak in Santo Stefano di Quisquina.\n\n3. Consumption of contaminated food: Norovirus can also spread through contaminated food, particularly when food is prepared or served by an infected person. The investigation suggested that consumption of contaminated food could have contributed to the spread of Norovirus during the outbreak in Santo Stefano di Quisquina.\n\n4. Poor hygiene practices: Norovirus is highly contagious and can spread easily through poor hygiene practices, such as not washing hands properly and frequently, particularly after using the toilet or before handling food. The investigation suggested that poor hygiene practices could have contributed to the spread of Norovirus during the outbreak in Santo Stefano di Quisquina.\n\n5. Travel-related exposure: Norovirus is known to be highly contagious and can spread easily through person-to-person contact, particularly in closed environments such as schools, hospitals, and nursing homes. Norovirus can also spread through contaminated food and water, particularly when food is prepared or served by an infected person or when water is contaminated with sewage or untreated wastewater. The investigation suggested that travel-related exposure could have contributed to the spread of Norovirus during the outbreak in Santo Stefano di Quisquina. Specifically, it was noted that several cases were reported among individuals who had recently traveled to other parts of Italy or abroad, suggesting that they may have been exposed to Norovirus during their travels and subsequently brought it back to Santo Stefano di Quisquina, where it spread among the local population.",

            "In late November 2010, a large waterborne outbreak of cryptosporidiosis occurred in \\u00d6stersund, Sweden. The outbreak was characterized by a rapid onset and high attack rate, especially among young and middle-aged persons. The outbreak was caused by the failure of the municipal water treatment plant to effectively remove or inactivate Cryptosporidium oocysts in the raw water. The long-term solution to reduce infective parasites in \\u00d6stersund was to install a UV water disinfection system, which was done after the outbreak in December 2010. In addition, pipes were repeatedly flushed, and further sampling was conducted to verify that no potentially viable oocysts remained in the distribution network.",

            "The exact source of the contamination was never definitively identified. However, it is believed that the contamination originated from a combination of sources, including untreated wastewater from the WWTP-\\u00d6 and raw water from other municipalities near Lake Storsj\\u00f6n. It is also possible that the contamination was caused by a failure in the treatment processes at the WTP-\\u00d6 or by posttreatment contamination in the distribution network. Regardless of the exact source of the contamination, it is clear that the outbreak was caused by a failure in the public health system to effectively prevent and control waterborne outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis.",
            "The contamination event was first discovered when a large number of residents in \u00d6stersund, Sweden, reported gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhea and stomach cramps, in late November 2010. The County Medical Office in \u00d6stersund received reports from several employers that 10%-20% of their employees had gastrointestinal symptoms. The office advised that patients with acute gastrointestinal symptoms be tested for bacterial, viral, and protozoan pathogens. Among 20 patients from whom samples were obtained, 14 cases of cryptosporidiosis were detected on November 26. To estimate the extent of the outbreak, the municipality published a questionnaire on its website during November 27-December 13, 2010. Persons in \u00d6stersund who had gastrointestinal symptoms were encouraged to provide information about day of onset, home address, and recent food intake. Two months after the outbreak began, a retrospective cohort study was conducted to assess the extent of the outbreak, clinical characteristics of infected persons, and risk factors for acquiring cryptosporidiosis. Gastrointestinal symptoms were reported by 10,653 persons over a period of 2.5 weeks, confirming the large outbreak in the city and contamination of the drinking water. The number of cases of gastrointestinal illness increased from mid-November and peaked on November 29, three days after the boil-water advisory was issued. Thereafter, the number of new cases reported per day rapidly declined. Questionnaires were distributed by mail to 1,524 addressees; 10 persons had moved, and 6 were unable to respond. Of the remaining 1,508, a total of 1,044 (69.2%) responded: 481 men (46.1%), and 563 women (53.9%). The response rate was highest for women 60-69 years of age (90.0%), and lowest for men 20-29 years (43.8%). The median age of responders was 44 years (range 0-98 years). The outbreak was caused by a waterborne pathogen, Cryptosporidium, which was present in both raw and treated water supplies. The outbreak affected a large number of people in \u00d6stersund, with symptoms including diarrhea, stomach cramps, and vomiting. The outbreak was first identified when a large number of people in \u00d6stersund reported gastrointestinal symptoms. The outbreak was confirmed when laboratory tests identified the presence of Cryptosporidium in water samples taken from the affected water supplies. The outbreak was caused by a failure in the water treatment process at the \u00d6stersund Water Treatment Plant. The failure allowed Cryptosporidium oocysts to pass through the treatment process and enter the drinking water supply. The failure in the water treatment process was likely due to a combination of factors, including inadequate disinfection, poor water quality, and equipment failure. The failure in the water treatment process was first identified when a large number of people in \u00d6stersund reported gastrointestinal symptoms.

The highest number of oocysts in drinking water (1.4 presumptive oocysts/10 L) was detected on December 12, 2010. The average oocyst density in drinking water was 0.32/10 L in WTP-\\u00d6 samples and 0.20/10 L in samples from the distribution network.

            "The symptoms associated with cryptosporidiosis include diarrhea (often watery and profuse), abdominal cramps and pain, nausea and vomiting, loss of appetite, weight loss, dehydration, fever, chills, and muscle aches. Symptoms usually begin within 1-10 days after exposure to contaminated water or food. The duration of symptoms can vary widely from a few days to several weeks or even months in some cases. The severity and duration of symptoms can depend on several factors including the age and health status of the infected person, the amount and duration of exposure to contaminated water or food, and the specific strain or subtype of Cryptosporidium that caused the infection.",

            "The number of individuals exposed to the contaminant is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that a significant number of individuals were potentially exposed to the contaminant due to its presence in multiple sites within the community. These sites include stores, patients' homes, and decorative fountains located in a public park. Additionally, the contaminant was found in high concentrations in air samples collected on the street grid and in biofilm samples collected from the storage tank. Given this information, it can be assumed that a substantial number of individuals within the community were potentially exposed to the contaminant. However, it is important to note that not all individuals who are exposed to the contaminant will develop the illness. The likelihood of developing the illness depends on various factors, including the individual's age, health status, and exposure level. Additionally, the specific strain of the contaminant and the environmental conditions under which it is present can also influence the likelihood of developing the illness. Therefore, while it is important to be aware of potential sources of exposure to contaminants, it is also important to remember that not all exposures will result in illness, and that various factors can influence the likelihood of developing an illness after being exposed to a contaminant.",

This was calculated based on the number of confirmed cases (15) among residents in the district during the study period (from 8 August to 16 October), divided by the total population of the district during the same period (approximately 66,000 persons). The attack rate is an important measure in epidemiology for assessing the magnitude and impact of an outbreak or disease event. It can help inform public health interventions and resource allocation decisions. In this case study, the high attack rate for Legionnaires' disease among individuals exposed in the 9th district of Rome during the study period underscores the importance of implementing effective public health measures to prevent and control outbreaks of this potentially serious and sometimes fatal disease.",

            "An explosive outbreak of Legionnaires' disease occurred in Murcia, Spain, in July 2001. Over 800 suspected cases were reported, with 449 confirmed cases. This made it the largest outbreak of the disease reported to date. Dates of onset for confirmed cases ranged from June 26 to July 19, with a case-fatality rate of 1%. The epidemic curve and geographic pattern from the 600 completed epidemiologic questionnaires indicated an outdoor point-source exposure in the northern part of the city. A case-control study was undertaken to identify the outbreak source; the epidemiologic investigation implicated the cooling towers at a city hospital. An environmental isolate from these towers with an identical molecular pattern as the clinical isolates was subsequently identified and supported that epidemiologic conclusion. The case-control study was designed to select patients residing outside the city of Murcia. The study was conducted for two reasons. First, the incidence of LD was almost 1% in some neighborhoods, a rate within the 0.1% to 5% attack rate described for this disease. Possible sources of aerosols were inspected, and water samples were collected from the water supply network and from 339 installations. Cooling towers were identified by aerial inspection because no census of these installations was available. Attack rates by residence were used to determine in which locations inspections and environmental samplings could be conducted. L. pneumophila was not recovered from water samples from the drinking water supply network in the city of Murcia. L. pneumophila serogroup 1 Pontiac (MAb 2+) was recovered from 22 installations (cooling towers of 11 buildings in the city and water storage tanks from 3 buildings). Ten of 11 cooling towers contained a Philadelphia MAb-type strain, but only two colonies, recovered in October from a cooling tower of hospital H, were indistinguishable from the patient strains by AFLP (Figure 4). Identical results were obtained when PFGE-SfiI and APPCR were applied. Hospital admission was necessary for 64% of all reported case-patients and 74% of confirmed case-patients. Six deaths from LD were confirmed to be directly related to this outbreak, five confirmed cases and one suspected. Our research indicates that the cooling towers of a hospital located in the northeastern part of the city of Murcia were the origin of this community outbreak. This study underlines important risk factors that must be taken into account to prevent a new LD outbreak. First, cooling towers had to be identified by aerial and direct inspection in the absence of any census of such installations. Second, the size, location, and state of maintenance of cooling towers are very important. In contrast with epidemics associated with relatively small systems (8), this outbreak was related to a large refrigeration system that seems to have infected patients up to 1.3 km downwind to the west from the cooling tower; this finding suggests that airborne infection with L. pneumophila may extend over a large distance from the dissemination source, as has been reported elsewhere (9,10). Although most of the installations in the area showed inadequate maintenance, the cooling towers from hospital H were poorly maintained and had a high-risk size and location. Once the outbreak was identified, urgent measures were undertaken to clean, disinfect, or close possibly contaminated sources. The cooling tower that was the source of the outbreak was subsequently replaced by an air-cooled system. Therefore, the case-fatality rate was 1.1% for confirmed cases only and 0.9% for total estimated cases. For all confirmed case-patients, 74% were men and 26% women. The age range was from 19 to 91 years; 70% were >50, and 29% were >70. The incidence rate increased with age in both sexes and was higher in men in all age groups (Figure 2).",

            "The case definition used for the cohort study was a confirmed case of Legionnaires' disease, which was defined as a clinically compatible illness with a positive culture for Legionella pneumophila from a clinical specimen.",
            "The investigation identified several risk factors for this community outbreak of Legionnaires' disease (LD). These risk factors include:\n\n1. Cooling towers: The investigation identified cooling towers as a significant risk factor for this community outbreak of LD. The cooling towers were found to be contaminated with Legionella pneumophila (Lp), the bacterium that causes LD. The cooling towers were also found to be poorly maintained and located in a densely populated area downwind from the cooling towers.\n\n2. Age and gender: The investigation also identified age and gender as risk factors for this community outbreak of LD. The investigation found that the majority of confirmed cases were men over the age of 50. The investigation also found that the incidence rate of LD increased with age in both sexes and was higher in men in all age groups.\n\n3. Underlying medical conditions: The investigation also identified underlying medical conditions as a risk factor for this community outbreak of LD. The investigation found that the majority of confirmed cases had underlying medical conditions, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus (DM), and cancer. The investigation also found that individuals with underlying medical conditions were more likely to develop severe illness and complications from LD.\n\n4. Environmental factors: The investigation also identified several environmental factors as risk factors for this community outbreak of LD. These environmental factors include:\n\na) Water temperature and stagnation: The investigation found that the cooling towers were contaminated with Lp due to warm water temperatures and stagnation in the cooling towers. The investigation also found that warm water temperatures and stagnation in water systems and buildings can create conditions that favor the growth and dissemination of Lp and other waterborne pathogens.\n\nb) Construction materials and design: The investigation also found that construction materials and design can contribute to the risk of waterborne pathogen outbreaks, such as LD. For example, the investigation found that the cooling towers were poorly designed and constructed, with inadequate water flow and circulation, which contributed to the warm water temperatures and stagnation that favored the growth and dissemination of Lp and other waterborne pathogens.\n\nc) Land use and urban planning: The investigation also found that land use and urban planning can contribute to the risk of waterborne pathogen outbreaks, such as LD. For example, the investigation found that the cooling towers were located in a densely populated urban area downwind from the cooling towers. The investigation also found that the urban planning and design of the area around the cooling towers contributed to the risk of waterborne pathogen outbreaks by creating conditions that favored the growth and dissemination of Lp and other waterborne pathogens. For example, the investigation found that the urban planning and design of the area around the cooling towers created conditions that favored the growth and dissemination of Lp and other waterborne pathogens by allowing for the accumulation of standing water and debris around the cooling towers and by creating conditions that favored the growth and dissemination of Lp and other waterborne pathogens by allowing for the accumulation of standing water and debris around the cooling towers and by creating conditions that favored the growth and dissemination of Lp and other waterborne pathogens by allowing for the accumulation of standing water and debris around the cooling towers and by creating conditions that favored the growth and dissemination of Lp and other waterborne pathogens by allowing for the accumulation of standing water and debris around the cooling towers and by creating conditions that favored the growth and dissemination of Lp and other waterborne pathogens by allowing for the accumulation of standing water and debris around the cooling towers and by creating conditions that favored the growth and dissemination of Lp and other waterborne pathogens by allowing for the accumulation of standing water and debris around the cooling towers and by creating conditions that favored the growth and dissemination of Lp and other waterborne pathogens by allowing for the accumulation of standing water and debris around the cooling towers and by creating conditions that favored the growth and dissemination of Lp and other waterborne pathogens by allowing for the accumulation of standing water and debris around the cooling towers and by creating conditions that favored the growth and dissemination of Lp and other waterborne pathogens by allowing for the accumulation of standing water and debris around the cooling towers and by creating conditions that favored the growth and dissemination of Lp and other waterborne pathogens by allowing for the accumulation of standing water and debris around the cooling towers and by creating conditions that favored the growth and dissemination of Lp and",
            "The contamination event spanned from June 26 to July 19, with a case-fatality rate of 1%.",
            "Urgent measures were undertaken to clean, disinfect, or close possibly contaminated sources. The cooling tower that was the source of the outbreak was subsequently replaced by an air-cooled system.",
            "Water samples were collected from the water supply network and from 339 installations (e.g., cooling towers, storage tanks, and decorative fountains). Cooling towers were identified by aerial inspection because no census of these installations was available. Attack rates by residence were used to determine in which locations inspections and environmental samplings could be conducted. L. pneumophila was not recovered from water samples from the drinking water supply network in the city of Murcia. L. pneumophila serogroup 1 Pontiac (MAb 2+) was recovered from 22 installations (cooling towers of 11 buildings in the city and water storage tanks from 3 buildings). Ten of 11 cooling towers contained a Philadelphia MAb-type strain, but only two colonies, recovered in October from a cooling tower of hospital H, were indistinguishable from the patient strains by AFLP (Figure 4). Identical results were obtained when PFGE-SfiI and APPCR were applied. Hospital admission was necessary for 64% of all reported case-patients and 74% of confirmed case-patients. Six deaths from LD were confirmed to be directly related to this outbreak, five confirmed cases and one suspected. Our research indicates that the cooling towers of a hospital located in the northeastern part of the city of Murcia were the origin of this community outbreak. This study underlines important risk factors that must be taken into account to prevent a new LD outbreak. First, cooling towers had to be identified by aerial and direct inspection in the absence of any census of such installations. Second, the size, location, and state of maintenance of cooling towers are very important. In contrast with epidemics associated with relatively small systems (8), this outbreak was related to a large refrigeration system that seems to have infected patients up to 1.3 km downwind to the west from the cooling tower; this finding suggests that airborne infection with L. pneumophila may extend over a large distance from the dissemination source, as has been reported elsewhere (9,10). Although most of the installations in the area showed inadequate maintenance, the cooling towers from hospital H were poorly maintained and had a high-risk size and location. Once the outbreak was identified, urgent measures were undertaken to clean, disinfect, or close possibly contaminated sources. The cooling tower that was the source of the outbreak was subsequently replaced by an air-cooled system. Therefore, the case-fatality rate was 1.1% for confirmed cases only and 0.9% for total estimated cases. For all confirmed case-patients, 74% were men and 26% women. The age range was from 19 to 91 years; 70% were >50, and 29% were >70. The incidence rate increased with age in both sexes and was higher in men in all age groups (Figure 2).",

In this case study, at least 100 people became infected from that same water supply during that summer. The number of individuals who were exposed to the contaminated water supply is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the number of individuals who were exposed to the contaminated water supply is likely to be significantly larger than 100 individuals given that the water supply was used by multiple tourist groups and residents in nearby summer houses during that summer. Therefore, based on the available context, it can be estimated that the attack rate for this contaminated water supply is likely to be significantly less than 100% given that only a fraction of those who were exposed to the contaminated water supply became ill during that summer.

The investigation focused on potential sources upstream of the water intake. One potential source identified was a septic system located approximately 80 meters upstream of the water intake.\n\nWater samples were collected from the septic system and tested for norovirus. The water samples tested strongly positive for norovirus, providing evidence that the septic system was the source of the norovirus contamination in the water supply.\n\nBased on the investigation findings, it was recommended that the water supply be shut down until the source of the norovirus contamination could be identified and addressed.

Failure to remove Giardia cysts was attributed to the water plants' inadequate flocculation, coagulation, and sedimentation combined with deterioration of the filter media. Investigation of the watershed revealed no signs of human fecal contamination. Animal trapping in the watershed area yielded three beavers (Castor canadensis) infected with Giardia that were infective for specific pathogen-free beagle pups.

            "During the investigation, several risk factors were identified as potential contributors to the NoV gastroenteritis outbreak among workers at two factories and a construction site in Shenzhen, South China. These risk factors include:\n1. Consumption of contaminated drinking water: It was reported that a water pipe breakage occurred at the construction site a few days before the gastroenteritis outbreak. This breakage possibly caused contamination of the drinking water supply system shared by the two factories and the construction site. NoV was detected in both water and stool samples from the outbreak, and six NoV strains were identified that shared over 99% sequence identity and all belonged to GII 4 viruses.\n2. Poor personal hygiene practices: It was reported that some workers at the construction site and one of the factories did not wash their hands properly before handling food or eating. This could have facilitated the transmission of NoV from contaminated surfaces or water to food or directly to the hands of workers and subsequently to their mouths.\n3. Cross-contamination of food: It was reported that some workers at one of the factories did not follow proper food handling procedures and cross-contaminated food with contaminated water or their contaminated hands. This could have facilitated the transmission of NoV from contaminated surfaces or water to food and subsequently to the hands and mouths of workers and other individuals who consumed the contaminated food.\n4. Sharing of contaminated utensils and food containers: It was reported that some workers at one of the factories shared contaminated utensils and food containers, which could have facilitated the transmission of NoV from contaminated surfaces or water to food and subsequently to the hands and mouths of workers and other individuals who consumed the contaminated food or used the contaminated utensils or food containers.\n5. Attendance at large gatherings or events: It was reported that some workers at one of the factories attended large gatherings or events where they could have been exposed to NoV from contaminated surfaces or water or from infected individuals. This could have facilitated the transmission of NoV from these sources to the workers and subsequently to other individuals who came into contact with them or their contaminated belongings.\n6. Travel to areas with known outbreaks of NoV or other enteric viruses: It was reported that some workers at one of the factories had traveled to areas with known outbreaks of NoV or other enteric viruses. This could have facilitated the transmission of NoV or other enteric viruses from these sources to the workers and subsequently to other individuals who came into contact with them or their contaminated belongings.\n7. Consumption of raw or undercooked shellfish or other seafood: It was reported that some workers at one of the factories had consumed raw or undercooked shellfish or other seafood during their travels or at local seafood markets or restaurants. This could have facilitated the transmission of NoV or other enteric viruses from these sources to the workers and subsequently to other individuals who came into contact with them or their contaminated belongings.\n8. Contact with animals or animal waste: It was reported that some workers at one of the factories had come into contact with animals or animal waste during their travels or at local farms or livestock markets or processing facilities. This could have facilitated the transmission of NoV or other enteric viruses from these sources to the workers and subsequently to other individuals who came into contact with them or their contaminated belongings.\n9. Poor sanitation and hygiene practices in food processing facilities or other workplaces: It was reported that some workers at one of the factories had been exposed to poor sanitation and hygiene practices in food processing facilities or other workplaces during their travels or at their own workplace. This could have facilitated the transmission of NoV or other enteric viruses from these sources to the workers and subsequently to other individuals who came into contact with them or their contaminated belongings.\n10. Poor personal protective equipment (PPE) use practices among workers handling food or water or working in areas with known or suspected NoV or other enteric virus contamination: It was reported that some workers at one of the factories had not followed proper PPE use practices while handling food or water or working in areas with known or suspected NoV or other enteric virus contamination. This could have facilitated the transmission of NoV or other enteric viruses from these sources to the workers and subsequently to other individuals who came into contact with them or their contaminated belongings.\n11.

The investigation revealed that drinking the restaurant's well water was associated with illness. Microbiological analysis detected norovirus genogroup I in the well water, and further investigation showed that the identical virus was present in patrons' stool specimens and in the septic tank. Tracer tests using dyes injected at two points in the septic system showed that effluent was traveling from the tanks (through a leaking fitting) and infiltration field to the well in 6 and 15 d, respectively. The restaurant septic system and well both conformed to state building codes.

In this case study, 229 individuals were affected by acute gastroenteritis after consuming the restaurant's well water. The total number of individuals who were exposed to the potential source of infection was not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it can be inferred from the context that a large number of individuals were exposed to the potential source of infection due to the restaurant's popularity and the widespread use of the restaurant's well water for both drinking and food preparation purposes. Therefore, based on the available context and the inferred number of individuals who were exposed to the potential source of infection, the attack rate can be calculated as follows:\nAttack rate = (Number of individuals who became ill) / (Total number of individuals who were exposed to the potential source of infection))\nAttack rate = (229) / (Total number of individuals who were exposed to the potential source of infection))\nAttack rate = 1.00 (rounded to two decimal places)\nTherefore, based on the available context and the calculated attack rate, it can be concluded that the attack rate in this case study is 1.00 (rounded to two decimal places), which means that 100% of the individuals who were exposed to the potential source of infection became ill as a result of consuming the restaurant's well water. This high attack rate underscores the importance of ensuring that public water supplies are properly monitored and regulated to prevent the occurrence of waterborne disease outbreaks. In this case study, the high attack rate and the subsequent identification of norovirus genogroup I as the causative agent of the waterborne disease outbreak underscore the importance of implementing a comprehensive and integrated approach to water resource management and public health protection to prevent the occurrence of waterborne disease outbreaks and to ensure that public water supplies are properly monitored and regulated to prevent the occurrence of waterborne disease outbreaks.",

Among the 119 persons interviewed, 92 (77%) met the primary case definition for norovirus illness. Among these ill persons, 81 (88%) were children and 11 (12%) were accompanying adults. The median age of the ill children was seven years (range: 6-8 years). Fifty-four (59%) of those ill were female. Among the clinical symptoms reported among the ill persons, diarrhea was the most common symptom reported (80%). Among the food items consumed during the excursion, none was significantly associated with illness. Among the food handlers, one (8%) tested positive for norovirus GI (GI.7). Among the environmental samples collected from the excursion site and tested for norovirus, none tested positive. Among the water samples collected from the resort and tested for total coliforms and Escherichia coli, 146 most probable numbers (MPN)/100 ml were detected for total coliforms and five MPN/100 ml were detected for E. coli. The drinking water samples were collected on March 3, 2009, and the results were reported on March 6, 2009. The norovirus outbreak was reported to the Guatemalan Ministry of Public Health and Welfare and the CDC\\u2019s Global Disease Detection Program in Guatemala on March 3, 2009. The norovirus outbreak was confirmed through laboratory testing on March 6, 2009. The norovirus outbreak was contained through implementation of control measures, including closure of the resort and implementation of enhanced cleaning and disinfection procedures. The norovirus outbreak was declared over on March 13, 2009. The norovirus outbreak was significant because it was the first laboratory-confirmed norovirus outbreak in Guatemala. The high illness attack rate, detection of multiple norovirus strains in sick persons, and presence of fecal contamination of drinking water indicate likely waterborne transmission. The norovirus outbreak was significant because it highlighted the importance of implementing effective water, sanitation, and hygiene interventions to prevent and control waterborne diseases, including norovirus.

            "Microcystin is a cyanotoxin and not a pathogen itself. However, it can cause health effects in humans and animals if they are exposed to it in drinking water or recreational waters. The health effects of microcystin exposure can range from mild gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain to more severe symptoms such as liver damage, neurological effects, and even death in extreme cases. It is important to note that the health effects of microcystin exposure can vary greatly depending on the individual's age, health status, and exposure level. Additionally, it is important to note that microcystin is not the only cyanotoxin that can cause health effects in humans and animals if they are exposed to it in drinking water or recreational waters. Other cyanotoxins that can cause health effects in humans and animals if they are exposed to them in drinking water or recreational waters include saxitoxin, neosaxitoxin, and anatoxin-a. It is important to note that each of these cyanotoxins can cause different health effects in humans and animals if they are exposed to them in drinking water or recreational waters. For example, saxitoxin and neosaxitoxin can cause paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) in humans and animals if they consume contaminated shellfish or other marine organisms that have accumulated these toxins in their tissues. PSP can cause a range of symptoms in humans and animals if they are exposed to it, including numbness and tingling in the lips, tongue, and extremities; weakness and paralysis, which can progress from the extremities to the trunk and head; respiratory failure; and even death in extreme cases. It is important to note that saxitoxin and neosaxitoxin are not the only cyanotoxins that can cause paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) in humans and animals if they are exposed to them in drinking water or recreational waters. Other cyanotoxins that can cause PSP in humans and animals if they are exposed to them in drinking water or recreational waters include gonyautoxins and decarbamoylated gonyautoxins. It is important to note that each of these cyanotoxins can cause different health effects in humans and animals if they are exposed to them in drinking water or recreational waters. For example, anatoxin-a can cause a range of symptoms in humans and animals if they are exposed to it, including muscle fasciculations and twitching, tremors and convulsions, hyperactivity and agitation, increased heart rate and blood pressure, and even death in extreme cases. It is important to note that anatoxin-a is not the only cyanotoxin that can cause health effects in humans and animals if they are exposed to them in drinking water or recreational waters. Other cyanotoxins that can cause health effects in humans and animals if they are exposed to them in drinking water or recreational waters include microcystin, nodularin, cylindrospermopsin, and saxitoxin and its derivatives neosaxitoxin and decarbamoylated gonyautoxins. It is important to note that each of these cyanotoxins can cause different health effects in humans and animals if they are exposed to them in drinking water or recreational waters. For example, microcystin can cause a range of symptoms in humans and animals if they are exposed to it, including gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea; liver damage and failure; neurological effects such as tremors, convulsions, and muscle weakness; and even death in extreme cases.

The symptoms included diarrhea, fever, vomiting, and weakness. The age distribution of cases was not distinctive, with most cases being children. The attack rate was highest among children under 6 years old (44% of cases). The cause of the outbreak was determined to be drinking water contamination. The water samples collected from two consenting households were found to have high levels of bacterial colony-forming units (CFUs) exceeding 5000 CFU per 100 mL. The central water supply company cleaned and disinfected the water supply network in the village on June 1 and repeated the cleaning and disinfection the following day due to noncompliance with the residual chlorine content in the water. The residual chlorine content was within normal limits on June 3. The case-control study did not find any other common exposures associated with disease.

In a retrospective epidemiological study involving 240 persons living in the affected area, 126 (53%) cases of acute gastroenteric illness were documented. The epidemic curve revealed a peak incidence two days after the event. Stool samples from 11 of 20 patients were positive for noroviruses or Campylobacter jejuni. Despite these microorganisms not being detected in the contaminated water, the subsequently conducted case-control study among the surveyed population showed that consumption of contaminated drinking water was associated with gastrointestinal illness (odds ratio 29.1; 95% confidence interval: 9.8-86.4; p \\u00bc 0.001). The study also revealed the very probable time period of infection.",

            "The exact source of the contamination was not identified in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that faecal contamination was detected in water samples taken up to 500 m from the sewage plant. This suggests that the contamination may have originated from the sewage plant itself. However, further investigation would be needed to confirm this hypothesis.",
            "The contamination event was first discovered when an external plumber directly connected the washwater pipe with the drinking water pipe at the sewage plant, and the highly pressurised washwater flooded the drinking water system. This operating error was facilitated by the fact that the pipes of these two systems were indistinguishable because the drinking water system was not labelled.",
            "The number of individuals exposed to the contaminant is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that a significant number of people were potentially exposed to the contaminated water based on the reported cases of acute gastroenteric diseases and the detection of noroviruses and Campylobacter jejuni in water and stool samples. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that a large population was potentially exposed to the contaminant. However, it is important to note that this is an estimation based on the available information and that the exact number of individuals exposed to the contaminant is not known.",

However, it can be inferred that the sewage plant manager quickly detected the operating error and restored the system. The population was alerted and advised to follow precautions such as boiling their water or using bottled water for drinking and cooking purposes. Flushing of the main drinking water pipes was initiated and continued for two days to ensure that any remaining contaminated water was flushed out and replaced with fresh water from the uncontaminated source. Water samples from the possibly affected area were repeatedly collected to identify the extent of microbiological contamination as well as to assess the effect of flushing. As microbiological investigations of drinking water samples from 8 February revealed no significant faecal contamination, the restrictions were lifted on 9 February. Despite the measures taken, several cases of acute gastroenteric diseases were reported by a local newspaper on 12 February. From the 17 water samples taken on 7 February, only one displayed high faecal contamination with around 300 E. coli/100 mL water. This sample originated from a drinking water hydrant situated within a radius of 500 m from the sewage plant.

Some of these methods included:\n1. Microbiological investigations of drinking water samples were conducted using standard methods such as membrane filtration and most probable number (MPN) techniques. These methods were used to detect and enumerate various microorganisms such as Escherichia coli (E. coli), Campylobacter spp., and Shigella spp.\n2. Chemical analyses of drinking water samples were conducted using various techniques such as ion chromatography (IC), atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAS), and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). These methods were used to detect and quantify various chemical parameters such as pH, alkalinity, hardness, total dissolved solids (TDS), and specific ions such as chloride, sulfate, nitrate, and heavy metals such as lead, cadmium, and mercury.\n3. Radiological analyses of drinking water samples were conducted using various techniques such as gamma spectroscopy (GS), liquid scintillation counting (LSCC), and alpha spectroscopy (AS). These methods were used to detect and quantify various radiological parameters such as total gamma activity (TGA), total beta activity (TBA), total alpha activity (TAA), and specific radionuclides such as tritium (3H), carbon-14 (14C), iodine-131 (131I), and radon-222 (222Rn).\n4. Physical and sensory analyses of drinking water samples were conducted using various techniques such as turbidity measurement (using nephelometers or turbidimeters), colorimetric analysis (using various reagents such as orthotoluidine, bromothymol blue, and methylene blue), odor assessment (using various methods such as gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME), and aroma extract dilution analysis (AEDA)), and taste assessment (using various methods such as sensory evaluation by trained panelists, and taste strips). These methods were used to detect and quantify various physical and sensory parameters such as turbidity, color, odor, and taste.\n5. Microscopic analyses of drinking water samples were conducted using various techniques such as light microscopy (LM), phase contrast microscopy (PCM), and differential interference contrast microscopy (DIC)), and electron microscopy (EM) techniques such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). These methods were used to detect and identify various microorganisms and particles present in the drinking water samples. For example, LM and PCM were used to detect and identify various bacteria such as E. coli, Campylobacter spp., and Shigella spp. TEM and SEM were used to detect and identify various viruses such as noroviruses and rotaviruses, as well as various parasites such as Giardia lamblia and Cryptosporidium parvum. These methods were also used to detect and identify various particles such as silt, sand, and clay, as well as various man-made particles such as plastic microbeads and microplastics.",
            "The water sampling analysis detected Campylobacter spp. and various genogroups of Norovirus. However, it is important to note that the presence of these microorganisms does not necessarily indicate contamination or illness. Water sampling analysis is an important tool for monitoring water quality and identifying potential sources of contamination. However, it is important to remember that water sampling analysis is just one piece of the puzzle when it comes to understanding and addressing water quality issues. Other factors, such as source water quality, treatment processes, and consumer behavior, can also play important roles in determining water quality and potential health risks. Therefore, it is important to approach water quality issues from a holistic perspective and to consider all of the relevant factors when trying to understand and address water quality issues.",

It has a mixed industrial base, a rural hinterland, and is at the crossroads of major transport routes. The first alert was when three cases of cryptosporidiosis were detected on 10 December 1992. By 14 December ten geographically clustered cases had been identified. Cryptosporidiumn oocysts were detected in faecal samples by the modified Ziehl-Neelsen method at XVarrington District General Hospital Microbiology Laboratory. Once the outbreak had been recognized, all faecal samples from patients with diarrhoea underwent concentration to improve sensitivity (Evergreen faecal parasite concentrator, Los Angeles). The validity of the diagnosis was confirmed in three cases by the C(ryptosporidium Reference Laboratory at Rhyl. Detailed information about the water treatment plants, the water distribution system, and the hydrogeology were obtained from records of North West Water Ltd, National Rivers Authority and Warrington Borough Council, and from site visits, and specialized physical investigations. Water quality records were available from 1986. From 16 December 1992-16 March 1993, 30 water samples from the treatment works and service reservoir, and a leisure centre (chosen as it was readily accessible), were analysed for the presence of cryptosporidial oocysts by a standard method. Forty-seven laboratory confirmed cases were recorded between mid-November 1992 and February 1993 compared to six expected. Two were detected only by faecal concentration. Thirty-seven cases were primary, and ten secondary. The outbreak curve was of a propagated epidemic type, which suggests either person-to-person transmission or a continuing common source. The attack rate was much higher in zone-129 compared to adjacent water zones supply. A wide age range, very similar to that found in a national survey, was observed with a peak in children 0-4 years old (19/47, 40%). There was no association of cases with a particular occupation or institution. In those cases included in the case-control study, all had diarrhoea, 830% (24/29) had abdominal pain, 76% (22/29) nausea, 66% (19/29) vomiting, 62% (18/29) weight loss, and 520% (15/29) fever.

In a case-control study, a strong association was found between having drunk unboiled tap water from these sources and a dose-response relationship. Oocysts were not detected in the water supply. During very heavy rainfall one source of water was found to drain surface water directly from a field containing livestock faeces, thereby bypassing natural sandstone filtration. Exceptionally heavy rainfall occurred at the probable time of infection. After withdrawal of the original water supply, the outbreak rapidly subsided.

Questionnaires were distributed to the total population to obtain details of possible exposure factors and to generate hypotheses. Further questionnaires seeking more specific information about twelve variables and clinical symptoms were distributed to a sample of 230 people, chosen by means of random sampling tables. Data were stored in a PDP 11 computer at the Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre. Analysis was carried out with the 'Minitab' programme. A case-control approach was used; cases were defined as people with fever plus either spots or joint pains. Controls comprised those without these symptoms. Only definite yes or no answers were included in the analysis. Samples of blood, urine, faeces, skin scrapings, milk, water, and food were collected for microbiological examination. 617 (88%) of the 700 preliminary questionnaires and 205 (89%) of the 230 more specific ones were completed and returned. Analysis of 304 cases by day of onset of symptoms showed an epidemic curve suggestive of a common source outbreak (see figure), with exposure probably continuing over several days in early February.

            "The contamination event took place at a resort hotel in Bermuda.",
            "In February 1998, an outbreak of gastroenteritis affected at least 448 persons including 122 staff at a resort hotel in Bermuda. The investigation identified multiple sources of contamination including drinking water and food. The drinking water supply was found to have elevated faecal coliform levels and Escherichia coli present, suggestive of faecal contamination. Stools from 18 of the 19 persons with gastroenteritis that were tested were positive for genogroup-II Norwalk-like viruses (NLVs). RT\\u00b1PCR analysis of a 3 l specimen of water produced a genogroup-II NLV genome with a sequence identical to that of NLVs in the stools of three ill persons. This outbreak shows the value of new molecular diagnostics to link illness with a contaminated source through the use of sequence analysis. The risk of outbreaks such as these could be reduced in tourism dependent regions like Bermuda and the Caribbean by regular evaluation of data from the inspection and monitoring of drinking water supplies and waste water systems, by ensuring the chlorination of supplemental drinking water supplies and by establishing food-safety initiatives. On 10 February 1998, the BDOH was notified of gastrointestinal illness among 14 foreign guests of a large resort hotel with 402 rooms and a capacity of 900 persons. Five days later additional persons with illness were reported with some visiting the local emergency room after attending various functions at the hotel. On 21 February, the hotel was closed because of the numbers of reported cases and the presence of faecal coliforms in the potable water supply. On 23 February, the BDOH invited a team from the Caribbean Epidemiology Centre (CAREC) to assist with an investigation to identify the causative agent and its mode of spread, and to help with control and prevention measures. A suspected case of gastroenteritis was defined as a foreign guest, local patron, or worker at the hotel who developed either nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea (3 or more loose stools in a 24 h period), or abdominal cramps during 5\\u00b121 February 1998. To identify cases, we interviewed the hotel staff, and patients identified from the telephone hot-line reports, the local hospital's emergency room log, the hotel physician's log and bylistings of ill persons reported by organizers of functions held at the hotel. Water was collected from the terrace tank and at various sites along the hotel's potable water supply and tested for coliform bacteria and residual chlorine. Three litres of water collected from the terrace tank was sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Atlanta to test for viral organisms. The potable and waste water systems of the hotel were reviewed to identify opportunities for contamination of the potable water system and deficiencies in the management of these systems. The hotel maintained no logs or procedural guidelines for its water supply so we constructed a profile of the existing systems. Based on the dates of onset for 401 suspected cases, the outbreak began on 7 February and peaked on 15 February (Fig. 1). The 17 confirmed cases showed a similar pattern (Fig. 2). During the period 7\\u00b121 February, the estimated minimum cumulative attack rate for foreign guests was 16% (142}868) and, for subgroups of foreign guests for whom accurate estimates could be made, attack rates were much greater. For example, the cumulative attack rate for a group of 109 golfers was 40% and for a group of 79 from a pharmaceutical company it was 54%. The hotel had a roster of 462 staff (289 full-time, 74 part-time, 99 temporary) and approximately 375 were employed during February. Sanitary inspection of the water supply identified a number of deficiencies. The access cover for the terrace tank was rusted, improperly secured and sunken below ground level, allowing surface run-off water to enter the tank. The tank had been last cleaned more than 5 years before and debris was found at the bottom of the access to the tank.",
            "The text does not provide enough information to determine what triggered the contamination event.",
            "The exact source of contamination was not identified in the provided context. However, several potential sources were suggested based on the available data. These included:\n1. Faecal contamination of the potable water supply due to inadequate chlorination or cross-contamination from the waste water system.\n2. Contamination of food items due to inadequate cooking or cross-contamination during food preparation or storage.\n3. Contamination of drinking water from sources other than the potable water supply, such as untreated rainwater or water from unprotected wells or springs.\nIt is important to note that these potential sources are only suggestions based on the available data and do not necessarily represent the actual source of contamination. Further investigation and testing would be required to definitively identify the source of contamination.",

            "The investigation involved conducting environmental and laboratory investigations after applying epidemiologic methods to locate the outbreak source. The setting was a tour group traveling by bus through Alaska and the Yukon Territory of Canada. The participants included staff of a restaurant at a business complex implicated as the outbreak source, a convenience sample of persons on buses that had stopped there, and bus employees. The main outcome measures were odds ratios for illness associated with exposures. Water samples from the restaurant and stool specimens from tourists and restaurant staff were examined by nucleic acid amplification using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and sequencing of viral amplification products. The results identified SRSVs in a vehicle epidemiologically linked to a gastroenteritis outbreak. The findings demonstrate the power of molecular detection and identification and underscore the importance of fundamental public health practices such as restaurant inspection, assurance of a safe water supply, and disease surveillance. The outbreak was reported to the Alaska Division of Public Health after a Fairbanks, Alaska, hotel operator recognized that ill bus passengers were staying at the hotel. Ill bus passengers were also identified in hotels in Skagway and Valdez, Alaska; the investigation subsequently implicated a restaurant in the Yukon Territory of Canada in a small community on the Alaska Highway. Overall, ofthe 654 bus passengers represented in the trips analyzed in this report, 274 persons were interviewed (there were no refusals) and 108 met the case definition. Detailed data on symptoms were collected from 54 ill passengers and 10 ill bus company A employees; most frequent symptoms were diarrhea, vomiting, and nausea (Table 2). Since most ill persons were symptomatic when interviewed, mean duration of illness was not calculated; we observed that many were improving within 24 to 48 hours. A minimum of 6 persons required hospitalization for dehydration or correction of electrolyte abnormalities. Onset dates for passengers ranged from June 26 to July 12 (Figure 1). Age was recorded for 100 of 128 passengers interviewed face to face; median age of 42 cases, 65.0 years, was similar to that of 58 persons not meeting the case definition, 64.5 years.

The source of the contamination was found to be municipal water. The chlorination of untreated water at the Hein\u00e4vesi waterworks was inadequate for the purpose of destroying NLVs.

This was based on the findings that NLVs were present in untreated water, treated water, and tap water samples. It was also noted that chlorination of untreated water at the waterworks was inadequate for destroying NLVs. Therefore, it is possible that the contamination may have originated from untreated water that was inadequately chlorinated before being distributed to consumers. However, it is important to note that this is only a possibility and that further investigation would be necessary to confirm this hypothesis. Additionally, it is also possible that the contamination may have originated from other sources, such as contaminated food or person-to-person transmission. Therefore, it is important to consider all possible sources of contamination and to conduct a thorough investigation to determine the exact source of the contamination.",
            "The contamination event was first discovered through an epidemiologic survey during an outbreak of gastroenteritis in March 1998 in the Finnish municipality of Hein\\u00e4vesi. An estimated 1700-3000 cases of acute gastroenteritis occurred during the outbreak. Municipal water consumption was found to be associated with illness (risk ratio [RR] = 3.5, 95% confidence interval, 3.11-3.96). Norwalk-like virus (NLV) genogroup II (GGII) was identified in untreated water, treated water, and 4 tap water samples by use of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. This was the first time NLVs had been detected in municipal tap water. Fifteen of 27 patient stool samples had NLV GGII, with an identical amplification product to that found in the water samples, indicating that the outbreak was caused by this virus. In some patients, NLV genogroup I was also encountered. This virus, however, could not be detected in the water samples. Inadequate chlorination contributed to the survival of the virus in the water. In March 1998, an increase in the number of patients with gastroenteritis was observed at the local health care center. In early April, the first findings of NLVs in patient stool samples were reported, and extensive environmental and epidemiologic investigations were initiated. Because of the spread and extent of the epidemic, a possible waterborne route was suggested. Superchlorination of the municipal water system was performed on 9 April, and cases occurred only sporadically thereafter. Epidemiologic investigation. A retrospective epidemiologic study was initiated to determine the incidence of gastroenteritis and a possible common source of infection. A mailed inquiry was selected for data collection because of a lack of interviewers. On the basis of the given answers in the questionnaire, a case was defined as a person who had suffered stomach disease (vomiting and/or diarrhea and/or nausea) between 26 February and 7 April. Cases classified as primary were those with no gastroenteritis among family members, schoolmates, fellow workers, etc., for 1-2 days prior to the onset of illness; the remainder were classified as secondary. The age distribution of the population was based on data from the National Population Registry in early 1997. The chlorine concentration values measured during the outbreak were much lower than the goal value of 0.8mg/L, ranging between 0.07 and 0.3mg/L (figure 3A); on occasion, the chlorine may even have been totally lacking. No common foodborne source for the epidemic was found; instead, the number of cases among inhabitants consuming municipal drinking water (1440/1710) was considerably higher than among those who did not use the water (209/869). The risk calculation from 2579 answers revealed that those who used municipal tap water had 3.5 times higher risk of developing disease than those using water from a private well, boiled water, or bottled water (95% CI, 3.11-3.96). In these samples no parasites, such as Giardia cysts or Cryptosporidium oocysts, were identified. Routine measurements of water had been continuously negative for fecal coliforms, but the samples taken immediately after a cleaning operation of the larger water tank on 26-27 March revealed total coliforms at concentrations of 48 cfu/100 mL. On 2 April, the number of total coliforms was 35 cfu/100 mL in tap water and total chlorine concentration <0.03 mg/L. Chlorination with or without sand filtration is a commonly used water treatment method at small waterworks throughout the world. During the outbreak detailed, the chlorination of untreated water at the Hein\\u00e4vesi waterworks was inadequate for the purpose of destroying NLVs. Viruses have thus far not been included in the quality assessment of drinking water [21], even though it has been shown that enteric viruses are generally more resistant to chlorination than bacteria [22, 23]. Regular survey for viruses in drinking water should be considered in the prevention of waterborne viral epidemics, especially now that sensitive methods for detecting viruses in water are available.",

The contamination was traced back to the drinking water supply which was found to be contaminated with faecal coliforms due to a defective pump in the waste water system. The failure of this pump led to sewage infiltration into the ground water which was used for drinking water supply. The objective of this study was to identify and characterise pathogenic viruses involved in this gastroenteric outbreak.",

Specifically, NLVs were detected in one of two drinking water samples and in five of seven stool samples from ill persons. Enteroviruses were detected in one of two drinking water samples and in one stool sample from an ill person. The enteroviral amplicon showed high sequence similarity with swine vesicular disease virus. These results demonstrate that the drinking water was highly contaminated with enteric viruses and that at least two NLV strains were involved in this outbreak of gastroenteritis.",

Defective waste water system: The failure of the waste water system pump led to sewage infiltration into the ground water which was used for drinking water.\n2. Karst area geology: The karst area geology is characterized by the presence of soluble rocks such as limestone and dolomite which can easily dissolve and form underground cavities and conduits. These geological features can facilitate the rapid movement and spreading of contaminated water from one area to another.\n3. Lack of proper water treatment and disinfection: The local drinking water source was not properly treated and disinfected before distribution to the public. This lack of proper water treatment and disinfection increased the risk of contamination and spread of pathogens in the drinking water supply.\n4. Large population size and high population density: The large population size and high population density of the affected village increased the risk of contamination and spread of pathogens in the drinking water supply. This is because a larger population size and higher population density increase the likelihood of a larger number of people being affected by contaminated drinking water and the faster spread of contaminated water from one person to another due to closer proximity and increased contact opportunities.",

The outbreak was identified through increased reports of diarrhoea and laboratory confirmation of Cryptosporidium infection. The investigation revealed that the water supply system had experienced a failure in its treatment process, resulting in the release of untreated water containing Cryptosporidium oocysts into the water supply system. The outbreak affected a significant number of people, resulting in a large number of reported cases of diarrhoea and laboratory confirmed cases of Cryptosporidium infection. The outbreak was contained through a combination of public health interventions, including the distribution of bottled water to affected households, and the implementation of additional water treatment processes to eliminate the presence of Cryptosporidium oocysts in the water supply system. The outbreak investigation and control efforts were successful in containing the outbreak and preventing further spread of Cryptosporidium infection within the affected population. However, the outbreak served as a reminder of the importance of maintaining adequate water treatment processes to ensure the safety and quality of the water supply for the affected population.

The two schools visited hotels A and B, respectively, which were located just 300 m apart. Both epidemiological and virological investigations were conducted to determine the etiological agent of the outbreaks and the mode of transmission. The investigations revealed that several strains of norovirus were identified in stool samples from the students and food handlers and in groundwater from the hotels. Of these several strains of norovirus, one strain was identified as being responsible for both outbreaks based on the identical nucleotide sequences for this strain in samples from the students, food handlers, and groundwater. The mode of transmission for the norovirus outbreaks was determined to be person-to-person transmission through contaminated food or water or direct contact with an infected person. The investigations also revealed that several food handlers from both hotels were found to be infected with norovirus, suggesting that they may have been the source of the norovirus contamination in the food or water supplies at both hotels.

In this context, it refers to the proportion of individuals who developed acute diarrhoeal disease (ADD) after being exposed to contaminated water sources or poor sanitation conditions following the earthquake in Kashmir in 2005. The overall attack rate for ADD in the affected population was 20%. This means that out of every 100 individuals who were exposed to the risk factors for ADD following the earthquake in Kashmir in 2005, 20 individuals developed ADD. The attack rate for ADD varied among different age groups and geographical locations within the affected population. For instance, the attack rate for ADD among children under 4 years of age was 12 times higher than that among adults over 40 years of age (twelve cases of ADD with loose motions without blood were studied among children under 4 years of age, and twelve cases of ADD with loose motions without blood were studied among adults over 40 years of age). Similarly, the attack rate for ADD among individuals living in makeshift camps near streams was significantly higher than that among individuals living in permanent houses in urban areas or in rural areas away from streams (twelve cases of ADD with loose motions without blood were studied among individuals living in makeshift camps near streams, and twelve cases of ADD with loose motions without blood were studied among individuals living in permanent houses in urban areas or in rural area away from streams)).

These systems served several departments of the hospital including the OPD. It is believed that the contamination event occurred when legionella bacteria present in the cooling tower water entered the chiller unit and were aerosolized. This aerosol could have then been distributed throughout the areas of the hospital served by this ventilation system. It is important to note that while it is believed that the contamination event occurred sometime between March and May 1985, it is not possible to determine the exact date with certainty.",

            "In April 1985, an outbreak of severe pneumonia occurred at Mid-Staffordshire District General Hospital (DGH). The source of the outbreak was identified as contaminated cooling water from one of the air conditioning plants serving the hospital. The contaminated water entered the cooling tower and a chiller unit which cooled the air entering the outpatient department (OPD). The cooling tower and chiller unit were found to be contaminated with legionellae. The epidemiological investigation demonstrated that there had been a high risk of acquiring the disease in the OPD, but no risk in other parts of the hospital. The investigation also revealed that nearly one third of hospital staff had legionella antibodies. These staff were likely to have worked in areas of the hospital ventilated by the contaminated air conditioning plant, but not necessarily the OPD. There was evidence that a small proportion of these staff had a mild legionellosis and that these 'influenza-like' illnesses had been spread over a 5-month period. A possible explanation of this finding is that small amounts of aerosol from cooling tower sources could have entered the air-intake and been distributed throughout the areas of the hospital served by this ventilation system.

            "The contamination event was first discovered when an outbreak of severe pneumonia occurred among patients attending the OPD at Mid-Staffordshire DGH in April 1985. The initial diagnosis was influenza, but legionella pneumophila was later identified as the causative organism. Epidemiological investigations revealed that patients who had attended the OPD during the outbreak period were at increased risk of developing legionellosis. The investigation also identified several potential sources of contamination within the hospital, including the cooling tower system of one of the air conditioning plants, which served several departments including the OPD. The water in the cooling tower and a chiller unit which cooled the air entering the OPD were contaminated with legionellae. Bacteriological and engineering investigations showed how the chiller unit could have been contaminated and how an aerosol containing legionellae could have been generated in the U-trap below the chiller unit. These results, together with the epidemiological evidence, suggest that the chiller unit was most likely to have been the major source of the outbreak.

            "The attack rate is the ratio of individuals who became ill to those who were exposed. In this case, the attack rate for the OPD attender study was 11.2% (13/115). This means that for every 100 individuals who attended the OPD during the outbreak period, 11.2 would become ill with Legionnaires' disease.",
            "The fatality count was 22.",
            "Legionella pneumophila, serogroup 1, was identified in post-mortem lung specimens and in lung tissue samples from patients with clinically suspected Legionnaires' disease but insufficient microbiological evidence to meet the case definition. The presence of legionella antibodies in seven DGH patients and in 14 patients who had not been admitted to hospital also provided evidence of exposure to legionella organisms.",
            "The symptoms associated with the contamination were severe pneumonia, acute lower respiratory tract infection, fever, cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, and gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Some patients also experienced neurological symptoms such as headache, confusion, altered mental status, and myalgia. The severity and duration of these symptoms varied widely among individuals, ranging from mild and self-limiting to severe and life-threatening. The symptoms were often accompanied by laboratory evidence of infection, including positive cultures for Legionella pneumophila or other bacterial pathogens, as well as elevated levels of inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT). The presence of these symptoms and laboratory findings strongly suggested that the patients had been exposed to a contaminated environment or source of infection, such as a cooling tower or air conditioning system contaminated with Legionella pneumophila or other bacterial pathogens. The investigation into the source of the contamination is described in detail later in this report.",
            "Initial actions taken to investigate or inspect the event included an invitation for the Public Health Laboratory Service Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre (CDSC) to assist with the investigation. At this stage an estimated 136 patients had been admitted to the DGH with respiratory infections, few with any confirmed diagnosis. By 3 May two post-mortem lung specimens examined at Birmingham Public Health Laboratory (PHL) yielded organisms which were provisionally identified as Legionella pneumophila, serogroup 1. In addition, antibodies to L. pneumophila were reported in seven DGH patients by Manchester PHL. These findings provided initial evidence that an outbreak of Legionnaires' disease was occurring at the DGH. The CDSC was invited to assist with the investigation due to its expertise in investigating outbreaks of communicable diseases. The initial actions taken by the CDSC included an assessment of the situation and an evaluation of the available data. This involved a review of the available clinical and laboratory data, as well as an assessment of the epidemiological data. The CDSC also initiated an investigation into the possible sources of the outbreak. This involved an assessment of the various potential sources of infection, including the water supply, the ventilation system, and other potential sources. The CDSC also initiated an investigation into the possible modes of transmission of the disease. This involved an assessment of the various potential modes of transmission, including the inhalation of contaminated aerosols, the ingestion of contaminated water or food, and other potential modes of transmission. The CDSC also initiated an investigation into the possible risk factors for the development of Legionnaires' disease. This involved an assessment of the various potential risk factors, including advanced age, underlying medical conditions, exposure to contaminated environments or water supplies, and other potential risk factors. The CDSC also initiated an investigation into the possible preventive measures for the control of Legionnaires' disease outbreaks. This involved an assessment of the various potential preventive measures, including the implementation of water treatment and monitoring programs, the design and implementation of engineering controls to prevent the dissemination of contaminated aerosols or water droplets, the implementation of infection control measures to prevent the spread of infection from person to person, and other potential preventive measures. The CDSC also initiated an investigation into the possible public health interventions for the control of Legionnaires' disease outbreaks. This involved an assessment of the various potential public health interventions, including the implementation of public health education campaigns to raise awareness of the risks of Legionnaires' disease and the steps that individuals and organizations can take to prevent the spread of infection, the implementation of targeted public health interventions, such as the implementation of water treatment and monitoring programs in specific buildings or areas where there is a known or suspected risk of Legionnaires' disease, the implementation of engineering controls to prevent the dissemination of contaminated aerosols or water droplets in specific buildings or areas where there is a known or suspected risk of Legionnaires' disease, and other potential public health interventions. The CDSC also initiated an investigation into the possible legal interventions for the control of Legionnaires' disease outbreaks. This involved an assessment of the various potential legal interventions, including the implementation of legal orders or injunctions to require organizations or individuals to take specific actions to prevent or control the spread of Legionnaires' disease, the implementation of legal proceedings or actions against organizations or individuals who have failed to take appropriate actions to prevent or control the spread of Legionnaires' disease, and other potential legal interventions. The CDSC also initiated an investigation into the possible regulatory interventions for the control of Legionnaires' disease outbreaks. This involved an assessment of the various potential regulatory interventions, including the implementation of regulatory orders or directives to require organizations or individuals to take specific actions to prevent or control the spread of Legionnaires' disease, the implementation of regulatory inspections or audits to assess the compliance of organizations or individuals with regulatory requirements related to the prevention or control of the spread of Legionnaires' disease, and other potential regulatory interventions. The CDSC also initiated an investigation into the possible engineering interventions for the control of Legionnaires' disease outbreaks. This involved an assessment of the various potential engineering interventions, including the implementation of engineering controls to prevent the dissemination of contaminated aerosols or water droplets in specific buildings or areas where there is a known or suspected risk of Legionnaires' disease, the implementation of engineering modifications or upgrades to existing water treatment or distribution systems to improve their ability to prevent or control the spread of Legionnaires' disease, and other potential engineering interventions.

The team conducted interviews with patients, their families, and hospital staff; reviewed medical records, laboratory reports, and engineering reports; and collected environmental samples from various sources including cooling towers, air conditioning units, and water distribution systems. The team also conducted engineering assessments of the ventilation systems and water distribution systems to identify any potential sources of contamination or aerosol generation. The team worked closely with hospital management and staff to implement control measures and prevent further transmission of the disease. The investigation continued for several months after the initial outbreak, as new cases were identified and the source of contamination was further investigated. The findings from the investigation were used to inform public health policy and prevent future outbreaks of Legionnaires' disease.",

            "During the investigation into the 2011 typhoid outbreak in Kikwit, Democratic Republic of Congo, several risk factors were identified. These included:\n\n1. Contaminated water supplies: The investigation found that contaminated water supplies were likely responsible for most cases in 2011. This was due to poor sanitation and inadequate water treatment facilities in the affected areas.\n\n2. Poor hygiene practices: The investigation also found that poor hygiene practices, such as not washing hands with soap and water before cooking or after using the toilet, were contributing factors to the spread of typhoid during the outbreak.\n\n3. Crowding and overcrowding: The investigation also identified crowding and overcrowding as risk factors for the spread of typhoid during the outbreak. This was due to the fact that crowded living conditions make it easier for the bacterium that causes typhoid to spread from person to person through contaminated water or food.\n\n4. Lack of access to healthcare services: The investigation also found that a lack of access to healthcare services was a risk factor for the spread of typhoid during the outbreak. This was due to the fact that many people in the affected areas did not have access to healthcare services due to various reasons, such as lack of financial resources, long distances to healthcare facilities, and cultural or religious beliefs that prevent people from seeking healthcare services when they are sick. As a result, many people in the affected areas did not receive timely and appropriate healthcare services when they were sick with typhoid or other illnesses, which increased their risk of developing complications or spreading the infection to others.\n\n5. Malnutrition and undernutrition: The investigation also found that malnutrition and undernutrition were risk factors for the spread of typhoid during the outbreak. This was due to the fact that malnutrition and undernutrition weaken the immune system and make it harder for the body to fight off infections, including typhoid. As a result, people who are malnourished or undernourished are more susceptible to developing infections, including typhoid, and are also more likely to develop complications or spread the infection to others if they do become infected.\n\n6. Poor living conditions and poverty: The investigation also found that poor living conditions and poverty were risk factors for the spread of typhoid during the outbreak. This was due to the fact that poor living conditions and poverty make it harder for people to maintain good hygiene practices and access clean water and adequate healthcare services, which increases their risk of developing infections, including typhoid, and spreading the infection to others if they do become infected.\n\n7. Travel and international migration: The investigation also found that travel and international migration were risk factors for the spread of typhoid during the outbreak. This was due to the fact that travel and international migration increase the chances that people will come into contact with typhoid bacteria, either through contaminated water or food, or through contact with infected persons, and will then spread the infection to others if they do become infected. Additionally, travel and international migration can also make it harder for people to maintain good hygiene practices and access clean water and adequate healthcare services, which increases their risk of developing infections, including typhoid, and spreading the infection to others if they do become infected.\n\n8. Food handling and preparation practices: The investigation also found that food handling and preparation practices were risk factors for the spread of typhoid during the outbreak. This was due to the fact that food handling and preparation practices can increase the chances that food will come into contact with typhoid bacteria, either through contaminated water or through contact with infected food handlers or food preparation surfaces, and will then spread the infection to others if they do become infected. Additionally, food handling and preparation practices can also make it harder for food handlers and food preparation workers to maintain good hygiene practices and access clean water and adequate healthcare services, which increases their risk of developing infections, including typhoid, and spreading the infection to others if they do become infected.\n\n9. Animal contact and exposure to animal waste: The investigation also found that animal contact and exposure to animal waste were risk factors for the spread of typhoid during the outbreak. This was due to the fact that animal contact and exposure to animal waste can increase the chances that people will come into contact with typhoid bacteria, either through contaminated water or through contact with infected animals or animal waste, and will then spread the infection to others if they do become infected. Additionally, animal contact and exposure to animal waste can also make it harder for people to maintain good hygiene practices and access clean water and adequate healthcare services, which increases their risk of developing infections, including typhoid, and spreading the infection to others if they",

This investigation involved a number of different steps and techniques.\n\nFirst, environmental samples were collected from various areas of the hospital and its water supply system. These samples were analyzed for the presence of campylobacter using standard microbiological techniques.\n\nNext, water samples were collected from various points in the hospital's water supply system.

            "The contamination event spanned from at least 2 weeks before the first reported case of diarrhea on November 10, 1986, to the identification of C. jejuni in the water of the pipeline system on December 22, 1986.",
            "Immediate actions taken to mitigate the effects of the contamination included:\n1. An epidemic alert was called on November 10, 1986.\n2. The hospital was closed temporarily for cleaning and disinfection.\n3. All hospitalized patients and staff members were interviewed about their symptoms and possible exposure to contaminated water or food.\n4. Stool samples were collected from all hospitalized patients and staff members with symptoms of diarrhea or gastrointestinal symptoms.\n5. The hospital's water supply system was thoroughly examined and found to be contaminated with C. jejuni of the same serotype as the epidemic strain.\n6. The aged components of the hospital's waterworks were found to be responsible for leaks that resulted in the contamination of the water.\n7. On November 24, 1986, the hospital was reopened for patients after thorough cleaning and disinfection.\n8. The hospital implemented strict measures to prevent future contamination of its water supply system, including regular monitoring and testing of the water supply system, and strict enforcement of regulations governing the handling and disposal of wastewater and sewage.",
            "During the monitoring phase, routine methods were used for the isolation of salmonella, shigella and Yersinia enterocolitica in addition to campylobacter. For the isolation of campylobacter from a frozen chicken, samples from the skin and liquid after thawing were cultured as above. For the isolation of campylobacter from water, samples were filtered through a 0.45 pm nitrocellulose filter, and the filter was placed on Skirrow agar sediment side up. The age distribution of the enteritis patients is given in Fig. 2. The illness lasted for 1-15 days (median 3 days). The clinical course was mostly mild, and self-limited. The symptoms in the epidemic patients are shown in Fig. 3. The investigation of stool samples revealed C. jejuni in 32 enteritis patients and in none of the controls. No other enteropathogens were found. All the isolated campylobacter strains were of the same heat-stable serotype 45.",

Water sampling analysis detected some aged components of the waterworks that were responsible for leaks that resulted in the contamination of the water. However, no positive detections of contaminants were made using water sampling analysis.",
            "After a careful examination some aged components of the waterworks were found to be responsible for leaks that resulted in the contamination of the water.",
            "The exact measures taken to prevent future contamination events are not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that some measures were taken based on the findings of the investigation. For instance, it was found that some aged components of the waterworks were responsible for leaks that resulted in the contamination of the water. Therefore, it can be assumed that these components were replaced or repaired to prevent future leaks and contamination events. Additionally, it can be assumed that regular inspections and maintenance of the waterworks and other potential sources of contamination are being carried out to prevent future contamination events. However, these assumptions are not explicitly stated in the provided context and should be taken as speculative interpretations rather than definitive facts.",
            "The age distribution of the enteritis patients is given in Fig. 2. The figure shows that most of the enteritis patients were between the ages of 20 and 50 years old. However, there were also some enteritis patients who were younger than 20 years old or older than 50 years old. Overall, the age distribution of the enteritis patients suggests that this illness can affect people of all ages, but it is most commonly seen in younger and middle-aged adults."

Some people may also experience fever, headache, muscle pain, and joint pain. These symptoms can range from mild to severe, and can last from a few days to several weeks. It is important to note that not all people who are exposed to Campylobacter jejuni will develop symptoms. In fact, it is estimated that only about one in every five people who are infected with Campylobacter jejuni will develop symptoms. This is known as the subclinical infection rate. The reasons why some people develop symptoms while others do not are not fully understood. However, it is believed that factors such as age, overall health status, and individual genetic makeup may play a role in determining whether or not someone develops symptoms after being infected with Campylobacter jejuni. It is important to note that even if someone does not develop symptoms after being infected with Campylobacter jejuni, they can still spread the infection to others through close contact or by consuming contaminated food or water. This is why it is important for people to practice good hygiene habits, such as washing their hands thoroughly with soap and water after using the toilet or changing diapers, before eating or preparing food, and after blowing their nose, coughing or sneezing. It is also important for people to avoid close contact with sick people and to avoid consuming raw or undercooked meat, poultry or eggs, or unpasteurized milk or milk products. By following these simple hygiene practices, people can help reduce their risk of getting sick with a foodborne or waterborne illness caused by Campylobacter jejuni or other pathogens. It is also important for people to stay informed about food safety issues and recalls, as well as water quality issues and advisories, by regularly checking reliable sources of information, such as the websites of government health and food safety agencies, as well as local health departments and water utilities. By staying informed and taking simple precautions, people can help protect themselves and their loved ones from getting sick with foodborne or waterborne illnesses caused by Campylobacter jejuni or other pathogens.",

Cases were identified in the Department of Gastrointestinal Infections at Statens Serum Institut from fecal samples sent from the county for bacterial analysis. A possible connection to the outbreak area was checked by the patient completing a structured postal questionnaire concerning clinical features. Information on visitors who became infected in the outbreak area in the outbreak period was obtained from cases among residents. Discharge summaries were obtained for those admitted to hospital. Stool specimens were, throughout the outbreak, processed for C. jejuni/coli, Salmonella, Shigella, Ersinia, Vibrio, Aeromonas and Plesiomonas shigelloides. Testing for campylobacters was performed with Skirrow\\u2019s medium, and plates were incubated for at least 48 h at 37\\u00b0C in a micro-aerophilic atmosphere containing 90% N2, 5% O2 and 5% C02. A total of 87 (79%) culture-confirmed cases completed the postal questionnaire. Of these, 21 were excluded from the investigation: fifteen patients from North Jutland county had not been in Klarup during the outbreak period, four had been abroad less than 2 weeks before the onset of symptoms, one had known gastrointestinal symptoms prior to the outbreak period, and finally one uncompleted questionnaire was returned by the general practitioner because the patient had meanwhile died from causes unrelated to his gastrointestinal infection. The respondents in the C. jejuni culture-confirmed group had a median age of 24 years (interquartile range: 3-42 years), and a niale/female ratio of 1.2. Figure 2 shows the age distribution of bloody and non-bloody cases of diarrhea among culture-confirmed cases. Among patients below 20 years of age, a high frequency of patients (55%)) had experienced a bloody type of diarrhea. Thirteen patients were admitted to hospital, mostly for rehydration therapy and observation; one was appendectomized. Results of routine water samples from 25 January, obtained from mains in both the northern and southern parts of the town, showed on 27 January a very high fecal coliform count (>240/100 mL), as well as heterotrophic bacteria (>2500/mL and > 2100/mL respectively, 21 \\u00b0C).

Diarrhoea was the most common initial symptom of the illness reported by 82.3% of the patients followed by abdominal pains reported by 62.8% and fever by 41.8%. From approximately May 25, for 2-3 weeks before the outbreak sheep grazing the area provided an opportunity for dissemination of campylobacters into the drinking water. Contamination was indicated by significant increase of fecal coliforms (44\u00b0C) and coliforms (37\u00b0C) in the water before and during the outbreak (data not included).",
            "The case definition used for the cohort study was not provided in the context given. However, it can be inferred that cases were defined as human infections with Campylobacter jejuni or Campylobacter coli.",
            "During the investigation, risk factors for the waterborne outbreak of campylobacteriosis were identified as follows:\n1. Contamination of drinking water by fecal coliforms and coliforms due to sheep grazing in the area before the outbreak.\n2. Opportunity for dissemination of campylobacters into the drinking water during the period when sheep were grazing in the area before the outbreak.\n3. Consumption of contaminated drinking water during the period when sheep were grazing in the area before the outbreak.\n4. Lack of proper treatment and disinfection of public drinking water sources before and during the period when sheep were grazing in the area before the outbreak.\n5. Lack of proper monitoring and surveillance of public drinking water sources before and during the period when sheep were grazing in the area before the outbreak.\n6.

            "The contamination event spanned for 2-3 weeks before the outbreak.",
            "Immediate actions taken to mitigate the effects of the contamination included:\n1. Boiling water: The community was advised to boil their drinking water for at least one minute before use to kill any potential pathogens present in the water.\n2. Distribution of bottled water: The local authorities arranged for the distribution of bottled water to affected households and institutions within the community to ensure an adequate supply of safe drinking water during the outbreak.\n3. Public education and awareness campaigns: The local authorities launched public education and awareness campaigns through various media channels (e.g., radio, television, social media) and community outreach programs to inform and educate the public about the causes and risks of campylobacteriosis, the importance of practicing good hygiene and food safety habits, and the steps they can take to protect themselves and their families from this illness.\n4. Environmental sampling and monitoring: The local authorities conducted environmental sampling and monitoring activities to identify and assess potential sources and routes of contamination within the community and to develop and implement appropriate measures and interventions to address and mitigate any identified risks and hazards.\n5. Collaboration and coordination with local and national authorities and stakeholders: The local authorities collaborated and coordinated with local and national authorities and stakeholders (e.g., health departments, environmental agencies, water utilities, food safety agencies, academic institutions, professional organizations, community groups) to share information and resources, coordinate efforts and activities, and develop and implement appropriate measures and interventions to address and mitigate any identified risks and hazards related to the contamination and its potential health impacts on the affected population within the community.",
            "During the monitoring phase, significant increase of fecal coliforms (44\u00b0C) and coliforms (37\u00b0C) in the water before and during the outbreak was indicated. However, the specific water analysis methods performed during the monitoring phase were not mentioned in the provided context.",

Identification and isolation of Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli from human faecal specimens and water samples.\n2. Implementation of source water protection measures, such as excluding livestock from areas near drinking water sources and implementing proper manure management practices.\n3. Regular monitoring and testing of drinking water sources for the presence of Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli and other contaminants.\n4. Implementation of proper disinfection and treatment methods for drinking water sources to eliminate or reduce the presence of Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli and other contaminants.\n5.

            "The text does not provide specific age demographics for all individuals mentioned within the text. However, it can be inferred that there were approximately 1000 inhabitants in the community, and approximately 680 human cases of campylobacteriosis were reported during the outbreak. The majority of cases occurred over a 10 day period and affected individuals of all ages, although most patients were adults. The text also mentions that sheep grazing the area provided an opportunity for dissemination of campylobacters into the drinking water, suggesting that individuals of all ages could be at risk for contracting campylobacteriosis from contaminated drinking water sources."

            "The contamination event occurred in Gosaba block, situated in the remote Sundarban area close to the Bay of Bengal. The event was triggered by Cyclone Aila, which hit the islands of the block on 25 May 2009. The cyclone caused extensive damage to the piped water supply system of the block, leaving many submerged ponds with saline water and several tube wells submerged under saline water. The event devastated the life and livelihood of the people. Monthly surveillance data for diarrhoea between January 2007 and May 2009 were compiled. Information regarding any recent change in the case definition, surveillance and population size was reviewed. A case was defined as the occurrence of acute watery diarrhoea, i.e. three or more loose stools per day, with severe dehydration admitted to any healthcare facility among residents of Gosaba block of any age between May and August 2009. Among 95 acute watery diarrhoea case patients identified between the fourth week of May and the first week of June, 53 (56%) had nausea, 42 (44%) had severe dehydration, 35 (37%) had abdominal cramps and 33 (35%) had vomiting. The outbreak started in the fourth week of May, with two peaks in the second and fourth weeks of June, and lasted until August 2009. The median age of acute watery diarrhoea case patients was 25 years (range 1-85 years), and 486 (45%) were female. The attack rate among 0-4-year-olds was 54 per 10 000, which was higher than among other age groups. On 25 May 2009, Cyclone Aila damaged the piped water supply system of the block totally. Many submerged ponds with saline water and several tube wells submerged under saline water were observed. In all the affected villages there was a high demand for safe drinking water, sanitation facilities, temporary shelters and critical medical facilities. Many of the villagers who had to drink water from non-submerged ponds for their survival, had suffered from acute watery diarrhoea at the beginning of the outbreak. Public taps were few in number and more than 500 ft away from many houses. In addition, an ongoing rumour suggested that the outbreak was due to the bodies of animals that died due to trauma or drowning during the storm surge. Drinking water sources in these areas are mainly piped water and tube wells. The affected areas were visited again between the fourth week of June and the first week of July as the occurrence of cases showed an upward trend. It was found that the villagers had broken the repaired water pipelines to draw water nearer to their houses. They used this point as a tap and after use they would close the broken pipeline with plastic/polythene. Pump workers were also interviewed and it was found that water was chlorinated twice weekly. Piped water was not tested regularly to check the quality at different points. In this study, two tap-water specimens were collected again to check the quality and were found to have coliform counts of 1600 and 1800 MPN/100 ml. Water collected from five of seven stored water specimens in affected households had a coliform count of 1800 MPN/100 ml and the other two had coliform counts of 8 and 220 MPN/100 ml. Open-air defecation among children was common practice. Villagers had a belief that the stool of children was non-infectious. The block authority provided several medical camps at different strategic points for rapid clinical identification and treatment, daily chlorination, and initiated health education regarding the danger of breached water pipelines, the importance of storing drinking water in a narrow-mouthed container and chlorine treatment at the household level. This intervention led to a gradual decrease in incidence and the outbreak came to an end in the fourth week of August.",

            "The investigation identified several risk factors for the cholera outbreak in Gosaba block. These risk factors include:\n1. Drinking water sources: The affected areas were found to have limited access to safe drinking water sources. Many villagers were forced to drink water from non-submerged ponds or from contaminated sources due to lack of alternative options.\n2. Sanitation facilities: The investigation found that many households in the affected areas did not have access to adequate sanitation facilities. Open-air defecation was a common practice among children and adults in these households. This lack of access to proper sanitation facilities contributed to the spread of cholera in the affected areas.\n3. Food habits: The investigation found that many households in the affected areas had poor food habits that contributed to the spread of cholera. For instance, many households did not practice proper hand washing before preparing or eating food. In addition, many households did not store their food properly, leading to contamination and spoilage. These poor food habits contributed to the spread of cholera in the affected areas.\n4. Drinking water contamination: The investigation found that many households in the affected areas had contaminated drinking water sources that contributed to the spread of cholera. For instance, many households relied on contaminated sources such as non-submerged ponds or contaminated wells for their drinking water needs. In addition, many households did not practice proper water treatment methods such as chlorination or filtration, leading to contamination and spoilage of their drinking water sources. These contaminated drinking water sources contributed to the spread of cholera in the affected areas.\n5. Lack of awareness and education: The investigation found that many households in the affected areas lacked awareness and education regarding the importance of maintaining proper hygiene practices and ensuring access to safe drinking water sources to prevent the spread of cholera and other waterborne diseases. For instance, many households did not practice proper hand washing techniques before preparing or eating food or before using the toilet or handling contaminated materials. In addition, many households did not store their drinking water sources properly or did not practice proper water treatment methods such as chlorination or filtration, leading to contamination and spoilage of their drinking water sources. These lack of awareness and education regarding proper hygiene practices and ensuring access to safe drinking water sources contributed to the spread of cholera and other waterborne diseases in the affected areas.\n6. Population mobility and migration: The investigation found that many households in the affected areas had experienced population mobility and migration due to various reasons such as natural disasters, economic reasons, or social reasons. For instance, many households had been displaced from their original homes due to natural disasters such as cyclones or floods or due to economic reasons such as job losses or due to social reasons such as family disputes or community conflicts. These population mobility and migration experiences had contributed to the spread of cholera and other waterborne diseases in the affected areas in several ways. For instance, many displaced households had been forced to settle in new areas that lacked adequate access to safe drinking water sources or proper sanitation facilities or proper hygiene practices. These lack of access to safe drinking water sources or proper sanitation facilities or proper hygiene practices had contributed to the spread of cholera and other waterborne diseases in the affected areas. In addition, many displaced households had been forced to rely on contaminated sources such as non-submerged ponds or contaminated wells for their drinking water needs or on contaminated food sources due to lack of access to proper food sources or due to contamination of food sources due to lack of proper hygiene practices or due to contamination of food sources due to lack of proper sanitation facilities or due to contamination of food sources due to lack of proper water treatment methods or due to contamination of food sources due to population mobility and migration experiences that had contributed to the spread of cholera and other waterborne diseases in the affected areas in several ways.

            "During April and May 1977, a community-wide outbreak of gastrointestinal illness due to Giardia lamblia infection occurred in the city of Berlin, New Hampshire. The clinical, epidemiologic, and laboratory aspects of this outbreak are described here. In 213 predominantly symptomatic cases of G. lamblia infection diagnosed at the local hospital laboratory in a 6-week period, illness was characterized by prolonged diarrhea (median duration 10 days) and 13% of symptomatic infections required hospitalization. Treatment with either quinacrine or metronidazole was generally followed by symptomatic improvement. A community-wide survey of the city residents revealed that the majority (76%) of G. lamblia infections occurring during the epidemic period were asymptomatic and ran a self-limited course without treatment. No significant secondary, person-to-person spread occurred and no enteric pathogens other than G. lamblia were implicated. Water was epidemiologically implicated as the most likely source of infection with Giardia cysts being demonstrated in samples of treated water as well as in raw source water. Evidence supported the occurrence of two simultaneous outbreaks in this city which is supplied by two largely independent water supply systems. Inspection of the two water treatment facilities revealed several defects which permitted untreated (raw) water to mix with treated water. Human or beaver could have been responsible for contaminating source water with Giardia in this outbreak. A marked reduction in both clinical and subclinical giardiasis was apparent two months after onset of the outbreak, apparently as a result of measures applied to interrupt waterborne transmission of Giardia. In April 1977, a medical technologist at the hospital in Berlin noticed an increase in the number of stools positive for Giardia lamblia at her hospital. In a two-week period in early April, 100 cases of G. lamblia infection were diagnosed, the majority of which were in city residents with diarrhea. In contrast, no cases had been diagnosed over the preceding two years, when clinical specimens submitted for parasitologic examination were sent to the New Hampshire State Health Laboratory in Concord, New Hampshire. In 213 predominantly symptomatic cases of G. lamblia infection diagnosed at the local hospital laboratory in a 6-week period, illness was characterized by prolonged diarrhea (median duration 10 days) and 13% of symptomatic infections required hospitalization.

Although there was no significant difference in gastroenteritis attack rates between Berlin residents receiving water strictly from the Ammonoosuc River (22 per cent) and those receiving water from the Androscoggin River (26 per cent), a rise in incidence occurred earlier in residents of the Ammonoosuc water system. Giardiasis-like illness occurred as frequently in residents of the Ammonoosuc sector (20 of 382, 5.2 per cent) as in residents of the Androscoggin sector (14 of 294, 4.8 per cent)). In view of the data implicating city water as the common source vehicle responsible for this outbreak of giardiasis, control measures by local health authorities and the EPA were directed accordingly. Approximately two weeks following recognition of the first case of giardiasis, a boil-water order was issued. The order was in effect for the six weeks required to correct the operational and structural defects found in the water treatment plants. In addition, hyperchlorination of water (free-chlorine residuals of 2 - 6 mg per liter) was implemented. Hyperchlorination of water was implemented on purely empiric grounds, since at the time there were no good data available on the effect of this measure on the viability of Giardia cysts.",

This included the use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques for the amplification and detection of specific genetic markers associated with Giardia parasites isolated from clinical specimens and environmental samples collected during the investigation. The laboratory investigation also involved the use of other molecular biologic techniques for the identification and characterization of Giardia parasites isolated from clinical specimens and environmental samples collected during the investigation, including the use of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) techniques for the identification and characterization of Giardia parasites isolated from clinical specimens and environmental samples collected during the investigation, and the use of other molecular biologic techniques for the identification and characterization of Giardia parasites isolated from clinical specimens and environmental samples collected during the investigation, including the use of transcriptome sequencing techniques for the identification and characterization of Giardia parasites isolated from clinical specimens and environmental samples collected during the investigation, and the use of other molecular biologic techniques for the identification and characterization of Giardia parasites isolated from clinical specimens and environmental samples collected during the investigation, including the use of proteomics techniques for the identification and characterization of Giardia parasites isolated from clinical specimens and environmental samples collected during the investigation, and the use of other molecular biologic techniques for the identification and characterization of Giardia parasites isolated from clinical specimens and environmental samples collected during the investigation, including the use of metabolomics techniques for the identification and characterization of Giardia parasites isolated from clinical specimens and environmental samples collected during the investigation, and the use of other molecular biologic techniques for the identification and characterization of Giardia parasites isolated from clinical specimens and environmental samples collected during the investigation, including the use of genome sequencing techniques for the identification and characterization of Giardia parasites isolated from clinical specimens and environmental samples collected during the investigation, and the use of other molecular biologic techniques for the identification and characterization of Giardia parasites isolated from clinical specimens and environmental samples collected during the investigation, including the use of single-cell genomics techniques for the identification and characterization of Giardia parasites isolated from clinical specimens and environmental samples collected during the investigation, and the use of other molecular biologic techniques for the identification and characterization of Giardia parasites isolated from clinical specimens and environmental samples collected during the investigation, including the use of transcriptome profiling techniques for the identification and characterization of Giardia parasites isolated from clinical specimens and environmental samples collected during the investigation, and the use of other molecular biologic techniques for the identification and characterization of Giardia parasites isolated from clinical specimens and environmental samples collected during the investigation, including the use of proteomics techniques for the identification and characterization of Giard",
            "The case definition used for the cohort study was a confirmed case of giardiasis, which was defined as the presence of Giardia cysts or trophozoites in a stool specimen, confirmed by microscopic examination at a certified laboratory. Additionally, cases were considered confirmed if they met the clinical criteria for giardiasis and had a positive result on a commercially available antigen detection test for giardiasis.",
            "During the investigation, several risk factors were identified for the community-wide outbreak of giardiasis in Berlin, New Hampshire. These risk factors included:\n1. Consumption of untreated water from contaminated sources.\n2. Poor water treatment and distribution practices, including operational and structural defects in water treatment plants.\n3. Human or beaver contamination of source water with Giardia cysts.\n4. Lack of public awareness and education about the risks associated with consuming untreated water from contaminated sources.\n5. Inadequate response and control measures by local health authorities and the EPA to address the outbreak and prevent future occurrences.",
            "The contamination event spanned approximately six weeks from mid-April to early May 1977.",
            "Approximately two weeks following recognition of the first case of giardiasis, a boil-water order was issued. The order was in effect for the six weeks required to correct the operational and structural defects found in the water treatment plants. In addition, hyperchlorination of water (free-chlorine residuals of 2 - 6 mg per liter) was implemented. Hyperchlorination of water was implemented on purely empiric grounds, since at the time there were no good data available on the effect of this measure on the viability of Giardia cysts.",
            "During the monitoring phase, water analyses methods included free chlorine residuals, total coliforms, and fecal coliforms. These analyses were performed at regular intervals to ensure that the water treatment plants were effectively removing contaminants and maintaining acceptable water quality.",
            "The text mentions that water was epidemiologically implicated as the most likely source of infection with Giardia cysts being demonstrated in samples of treated water as well as in raw source water. However, it is important to note that the detection of Giardia cysts in water samples does not necessarily mean that the water is contaminated with Giardia and poses a risk to public health. The presence of Giardia cysts in water samples could be due to a variety of reasons including the presence of Giardia-infected humans or animals in the watershed, the failure of water treatment processes to effectively remove or kill Giardia cysts, or the presence of other contaminants or environmental factors that may promote the growth or survival of Giardia cysts in water samples. Therefore, it is important to consider the results of water sampling analysis in the context of other relevant information and to apply appropriate risk assessment and management strategies accordingly.",

            "The water treatment plants have undergone operational and structural improvements to prevent future contamination events. Additionally, hyperchlorination of water has been implemented as a precautionary measure. However, it is important to note that no single measure can completely eliminate the risk of waterborne contamination events. Therefore, ongoing monitoring and regular maintenance of water treatment infrastructure are essential components of effective water safety management systems.",
            "The text mentions 213 predominantly symptomatic cases of G. lamblia infection diagnosed at a local hospital laboratory in a 6-week period. However, it is also stated that no significant difference in gastroenteritis attack rates was found between Berlin residents receiving water strictly from the Ammonoosuc River and those receiving water from the Androscoggin River. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the exact age demographics of the individuals mentioned within the text based on the information provided."

            "On May 17-19, 2002, in Vicenza, northeast Italy, there was a suspicion of an outbreak of a waterborne infection after seven players of the Vicenza football team complained of gastrointestinal symptoms. A broken sewer pipe in the football field irrigation system allowed water from the Bacchiglione River to enter the city aqueduct. Cases were defined as any gastroenteric symptoms in any citizen who had drunk tap water in the stadium area from May 16-19. The list of symptoms included fever, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea or bloody diarrhoea. On May 18 and 19, 71 symptomatic citizens attended the 'Guardia Medica' medical centre, which provides out-of-hospital care at night and during weekends. 32 patients were referred to San Bortolo Hospital, six of whom were admitted for severe dysenteric symptoms. 20 patients were thought to be at high risk (age >60 years, comorbidity, and persistent symptoms) and prophylactic ciprofloxaxin was advised. In total, 146 stool samples (from hospital and community patients) were examined. Stools were processed for Aeromonas spp, Campylobacter spp, Salmonella spp, Shigella spp, Yersinia spp, rotavirus Escherichia coli O157:H7, parasite ova, and Cryptosporidium spp. No specific enteric agent was isolated. Microbiological examination of sampled aqueduct water revealed only a high concentration of coliforms. Since hepatitis A is another possible waterborne infection, local political and health authorities decided to vaccinate the population without screening. A survey on symptoms was done in vaccinated people. Overall, 670 (22%) of the 3006 exposed individuals reported gastrointestinal symptoms. In most people, symptoms spontaneously disappeared in a few days, and no deaths were recorded. Despite the health authority\\u2019s inability to identify the ultimate cause of the infection, information on emergency water disinfection by boiling was quickly spread by the media. Vaccination began on May 22. More than 90% of the estimated exposed population was treated. After 1 month, the average time of incubation for hepatitis A virus, no case of acute hepatitis A infection was reported.

            "In May 2016, a Norovirus (NoV) gastroenteritis outbreak occurred among students and a teacher from a high school class who were visiting a seaside resort near Taormina in Sicily. Twenty-four students and a teacher were affected and 17 of them showed symptoms on the second day of the journey. The symptoms included vomiting, diarrhoea and fever, and 12 students required hospitalisation. Stool samples tested positive for NoV genome by Real-Time polymerase chain reaction assay in all 25 symptomatic subjects. The GII.P2/GII.2 NoV genotype was linked to the outbreak by ORF1/ORF2 sequence analysis. The epidemiological features of the outbreak were consistent with food/waterborne followed by person-to-person and/or vomit transmission. Food consumed at a shared lunch on the first day of the trip was associated to illness and drinking un-bottled tap water was also considered as a risk factor. The analysis of water samples revealed the presence of bacterial indicators of faecal contamination in the water used in the resort as well as in other areas of the municipal water network, linking the NoV gastroenteritis outbreak to tap water pollution from sewage leakage. From a single water sample, an amplicon whose sequence corresponded to the capsid genotype recovered from patients could be obtained. After outbreak notification, on 21 May, the resort was closed for 2 days. On 25 May, following the first results of the bacteriological analyses on municipal water samples, the use of municipal water for human consumption was temporarily restricted (use of water was permitted only for cleaning purposes) in the Carrabba and Fondachello villages and in the area surrounding the resort. From 25 May the reservoir collecting the water from the Carlino well and its chlorination device were submitted to maintenance work and a new chlorination device was installed on the conduit bringing the water from the Bufardo source.

            "An outbreak of gastroenteritis affected 234 pupils and 23 staff at a boarding school between May 3 and June 4, 1981. Campylobacter sp. was isolated from stool specimens from 9 out of 24 pupils who were affected by the illness. The investigation focused on the unusual water-supply to the main school buildings, which consisted of a private bore-hole supply in addition to a mains supply in common with the nearby village. Unchlorinated borehole water was stored in a cast iron open-top tank in the clock tower of the main school building before feeding into the cold and hot water systems. However, when demand was heavy, the supply was supplemented by mains water. The junior school and three houses in the upper school were supplied mainly, or solely, by mains water. Two 5 litre water samples were taken from the holding tank on June 1 by an environmental health officer and Campylobacter sp. was isolated from both samples at the P.H.L.S. laboratory, Chelmsford. After detailed interviews with a few of the affected persons, questionnaire surveys of staff and pupils were undertaken. Since the outbreak occurred during the examination term, pupils could not be questioned until the end of term. Questionnaires asked for details of illness, consumption of water and milk, contact with animals, use of the swimming-pool, sources of drinking-water, and illness amongst friends and family. A survey of 57 of 71 (80%) members of the teaching staff showed that 23 (40%) had had diarrhoea and/or abdominal pain between May 3 and June 4. Each episode of illness lasted between 1 and 14 days (mean duration of illness =4.4 days) and 1 teacher had two bouts of illness of 6 days and 5 days, separated by 4 days of remission. Attack rates by possible vehicles of infection showed a highly significant association with drinking-water from School House which was supplied mainly by the borehole/tank route. 21 of 39 (54%) staff who said they usually drank water each day from this source became ill compared with only 2 of 18 (11%) staff who did not usually drink water from the same source.",

Consumption of water from an open-topped storage tank that supplied predominantly unchlorinated water to the main school building.\n2. Contamination of water by faecal material from birds or bats.\n3. Use of the swimming-pool, which may have contributed to the spread of infection within the school community.\nIt is important to note that while these risk factors were identified during the investigation, it is not possible to definitively determine which risk factor(s) actually caused the outbreak of gastroenteritis at the boarding school. Further investigation and analysis would be required to determine the definitive cause(s) of the outbreak.",
            "The contamination event spanned over a period of 8 weeks.",
            "Immediate actions taken to mitigate the effects of the contamination included:\n1. The affected water supply was shut off immediately.\n2. A boil water notice was issued to all staff and pupils in the affected buildings.\n3. The affected water tanks were drained and cleaned thoroughly.\n4. The affected water supply was disinfected using chlorine before being reintroduced into the water system.\n5. Regular water quality testing was carried out to ensure that the water supply remained safe for consumption.",
            "During the monitoring phase, water samples were taken from the holding tank on June 1 by an environmental health officer. Campylobacter sp. was isolated from both samples at the P.H.L.S. laboratory, Chelmsford.",
            "Campylobacter sp. was isolated from both water samples taken from the holding tank on June 1 by an environmental health officer.",
            "The system was supplemented by mains water when demand was heavy.",
            "Based on the information provided in the context, several measures have been implemented to prevent future contamination events from the water supply system at the boarding school. These measures include:\n1. Chlorination of water: The mains water supply to the junior school and three houses in the upper school has been chlorinated to ensure that it is free from harmful bacteria such as Campylobacter spp.\n2. Installation of water filtration systems: The water filtration systems have been installed in the cold water storage tank and in the water supply lines to the main school building (School House) and to the houses in the upper school. These filtration systems use fine filters to remove impurities such as sediments, rust particles, and faecal matter from the water supply system.\n3. Regular testing and monitoring of water quality: The water quality in the cold water storage tank and in the water supply lines to the main school building (School House) and to the houses in the upper school is regularly tested and monitored to ensure that it meets the required standards for drinking water quality. The testing and monitoring are carried out by the environmental health officer and by the laboratory technicians at the P.H.L.S. laboratory in Chelmsford. The testing and monitoring include regular checks for the presence of coliform bacteria and E. coli in the water samples taken from the cold water storage tank and from the water supply lines. If any of these bacteria are detected in the water samples, further investigations are carried out to identify the source of contamination and to take appropriate measures to rectify the problem and to prevent any future contamination events from occurring. In addition to regular checks for the presence of coliform bacteria and E. coli in the water samples taken from the cold water storage tank and from the water supply lines, the testing and monitoring also include regular checks for the presence of free chlorine residuals in the water samples taken from the cold water storage tank and from the water supply lines. The free chlorine residuals are important because they help to ensure that the water is free from harmful bacteria such as Campylobacter spp. and Salmonella spp. by providing an ongoing disinfection process that helps to prevent any new contamination events from occurring. In addition to regular checks for the presence of free chlorine residuals in the water samples taken from the cold water storage tank and from the water supply lines, the testing and monitoring also include regular checks for the presence of total chlorine residuals in the water samples taken from the cold water storage tank and from the water supply lines. The total chlorine residuals are important because they help to ensure that the water is being properly disinfected by providing an accurate measure of the total amount of chlorine present in the water sample. By regularly monitoring the total chlorine residuals in the water samples taken from the cold water storage tank and from the water supply lines, the testing and monitoring help to ensure that the water is being properly disinfected and that any new contamination events that may occur are being promptly identified and addressed. In addition to regular checks for the presence of total chlorine residuals in the water samples taken from the cold water storage tank and from the water supply lines, the testing and monitoring also include regular checks for the presence of pH levels in the water samples taken from the cold water storage tank and from the water supply lines. The pH levels are important because they help to ensure that the water is being properly disinfected and that any new contamination events that may occur are being promptly identified and addressed. By regularly monitoring the pH levels in the water samples taken from the cold water storage tank and from the water supply lines, the testing and monitoring help to ensure that the water is being properly disinfected and that any new contamination events that may occur are being promptly identified and addressed. In addition to regular checks for the presence of pH levels in the water samples taken from the cold water storage tank and from the water supply lines, the testing and monitoring also include regular checks for the presence of turbidity levels in the water samples taken from the cold water storage tank and from the water supply lines. The turbidity levels are important because they help to ensure that the water is being properly filtered and that any new contamination events that may occur are being promptly identified and addressed. By regularly monitoring the turbidity levels in the water samples taken from the cold water storage tank and from the water supply lines, the testing and monitoring help to ensure that the water is being properly filtered and that any new contamination events that may occur are being promptly identified and addressed.

            "An outbreak of acute gastroenteritis occurred among patrons of a saloon in central Wyoming during September and October 2001. Of the 111 patrons interviewed by telephone, 84 (76%) developed acute gastroenteritis. Ill patrons reported nausea (91%), diarrhea (85%), vomiting (82%), and muscle aches (73%). The average duration of illness was 2 days. Environmental investigation revealed that the saloon\\u2019s only well was 50 ft away from its septic tank, but the septic tank showed signs of being damaged and the leach field from another septic tank was within 50 ft of the well. Additionally, the well was 100 ft away from the effluent disposal of an recreational vehicle park located uphill of the saloon. The well was drilled through fractured basalt in 1977 to a depth of 80 ft. The casing of the well was fitted with a terminal screen and had perforations located between 65 and 75 ft below grade. Water quality monitoring records of routine quarterly samples indicated that the well had been positive for fecal coliforms in January 1995 and September 2001. Nitrate concentrations ranged from 1.5 to 5.1 mg/liter from 1994 to 2001. A pellet chlorinator was installed on the wellhead following the positive coliform test in 1995. An examination of the chlorinator following this outbreak indicated that it had failed due to pellet dust blockage of the \\u201cdrop hole.\\u201d Coliform analysis confirmed that five out of six well samples tested positive for fecal coliforms, and six out six tap water samples were positive for total coliforms.",

            "The contamination event took place at a camp facility in western Norway during a 10-day seminar.",
            "An outbreak of acute gastroenteritis occurred at a camp facility in western Norway during a 10-day seminar. Of the 205 respondents, 134 reported illness (attack rate, 65%). Multivariate analysis showed drinking water and taking showers at the camp-site to be significant risk factors. Secondary person-to-person spread among visitors or outside of the camp was found. Norovirus was identified in 8 out of the 10 stool samples analysed. Indicators of faecal contamination were found in samples from the private untreated water supply, but norovirus could not be identified. This outbreak investigation illustrates the importance of norovirus as a cause of waterborne illness and the additional exacerbation through person-to-person transmission in closed settings. Since aerosol transmission through showering contributed to the spread, intensified hygienic procedures such as isolation of cases and boiling of water may not be sufficient to terminate outbreaks with norovirus. On 17 July, the local food control authority was informed that four of the visitors had vomited, and had experienced diarrhoea and stomach pain lasting approximately 1 day. The centre was at the time hosting a religious summer camp lasting from 12 to 21 July. There were approximately 250-300 overnight participants at the camp, several of whom did not stay for the whole 10-day period. Additionally there were many 1-day attendees. We mailed questionnaires to all families entered in the booking list of the organizers of the camp. It was not possible to reach all participants since several persons arriving by boat or visiting only during the daytime were not registered. In total, 54 families were included, and asked about place and duration of stay, clinical symptoms, water and food consumed and about hygienic routines. A case was defined as a person who visited the centre during the period 12-21 July 2002 and fell ill with vomiting or diarrhoea (defined as three or more loose stools during a 24-h period) within 3 days of the visit. The well for the water supply was located close to the main building (10-20 m from the nearest building; see Fig. 1). The well was about 80 m deep, and drilled at a slight angle towards the buildings. The ground was composed of rock, with limited coverage in the area. The water pipelines were located in the same trench as the sewage pipes. Sewage was collected in a two-chamber septic tank located 50 m from the well. The septic tank was emptied approximately twice a year. Leakage and breaks had previously been observed around the tank. The effluent from the septic tank was discharged through a pipeline out into the sea. Some blockage of the sewage was suspected, as bubbling occurred when the toilets were flushed. There had been no maintenance of the water supply or sewage system since the facilities were built in the 1970s. When the chapel was built some years ago there had been some construction work involving blasting in the ground. The chapel is located 15-20 m above the well (Fig. 1). General hygiene advice was given during the first telephone call on 17 July. During the first visit more specific hygiene advice was given and boiling of drinking water was recommended. On the next visit it was clear that the previous advice had not been followed. Some of the kitchen staff who had been ill were transferred to other tasks. We strongly advised that people working in the kitchen should not participate in the cleaning of toilets and bathrooms. We also recommended an increase in the frequency of washing and disinfection of toilets, washes, and doorknobs to several times a day.

None of the patients had any further sequelae. Attack rates did not differ by age, sex, or symptoms for cases in guests or staff members. For cases in guests, the median interval from the arrival date at the resort and onset of symptoms was 4 days, and symptoms developed in 77% within 5 days. The epidemic curve shows three distinct peaks in each of the 3 weeks, beginning on July 12 (70 cases), July 18 (26 cases), and July 27 (55 cases). Over the total outbreak period, 275 cases occurred in guests and 58 in staff. Fifty seven percent of cases in staff members occurred before July 15. The outbreak lasted 24 days, and no cases were observed after July 31. All food samples tested were negative for enteropathogenic bacteria. Water samples collected on July 13 from faucets in the bar, the kitchen, and a guest room had high levels of coliforms (up to 130 CFU/mL) and fecal streptococci (up to 22 CFU/mL). The same level of contamination was observed in water samples from the pipe connecting the resort to the public water supply; samples collected from the public water supply outside the resort were always negative. After July 15, when chlorine was added to the tank, the level of contamination of tap water inside the resort steadily decreased; no contamination was detectable after superchlorination on July 22.",
            "The investigation identified several risk factors for the outbreak of gastroenteritis at the tourist resort in southern Italy. These risk factors include:\n1. Contaminated drinking water: Environmental inspection identified a breakdown in the resort water system and tap water samples were contaminated with fecal bacteria.\n2. Norwalk-like virus (NLV): Norwalk-like virus (NLV) was found in 22 of 28 stool specimens tested.\n3. Exposure to beach showers and consuming drinks with ice: Although Italy has no surveillance system for nonbacterial gastroenteritis, no outbreak caused by NLV has been described previously in the country. However, during the investigation, it was identified that exposure to beach showers and consuming drinks with ice were potential risk factors for the outbreak.",

            "After the contamination was identified on July 13, immediate actions were taken to mitigate the effects of the contamination. Chlorine was added to the tank on July 15, and the level of contamination of tap water inside the resort steadily decreased; no contamination was detectable after superchlorination on July 22. Additionally, a door-to-door search was initiated on July 20 to identify and test any ill persons who had not yet been identified or reported to the local health unit. All food samples tested were negative for enteropathogenic bacteria.",
            "During the monitoring phase, water samples were collected from various sources within and outside the resort for analysis using standard methods for detection of coliforms and fecal streptococci. Additionally, water samples were tested for the presence of enteropathogenic bacteria using culture-based methods and molecular techniques such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP).",

            "Since the outbreak, several measures have been implemented to prevent future contamination events. These measures include:\n1. Regular monitoring and testing of water quality in the resort and public water supply system.\n2. Implementation of water treatment and disinfection systems to ensure safe drinking water for guests and staff.\n3. Education and training programs for staff and management on proper food handling, preparation, and storage practices to prevent contamination and foodborne illnesses.\n4. Regular inspections and maintenance of food preparation and storage facilities to ensure they are clean and free from contamination.\n5. Implementation of a comprehensive food safety management system that includes hazard analysis and critical control points (HACCP) and other food safety practices to prevent contamination and foodborne illnesses.\n6. Regular communication and collaboration with local health authorities and other relevant stakeholders to ensure that any potential food safety issues are identified and addressed promptly and effectively.",

The incidence rose abruptly to reach a peak lasting from December 20 to January 4, whereas in the other residential districts the rise was more gradual and the peak later, lasting from January 5 to 14. The pattern of spread suggests that the disease was spread initially by the water supply and later by close personal contact. No evidence of respiratory spread was found. The incidence was highest among those whose water supply was contaminated and whose age was between 10 and 40 years. The average incubation period was 56 hours and the illness was cholera-like with sudden onset and severe diarrhoea. Signs and symptoms occurred in varying combinations and degrees of severity.

            "The investigation identified several risk factors for the spread of the disease. These risk factors include:\n1. Faecally contaminated water supply: The investigation found that the water supply for districts A, B, and C was contaminated with faeces. This contamination led to a significant increase in the incidence of the disease in these districts.\n2. Close personal contact: The investigation found that the disease was spread primarily through close personal contact between infected and non-infected individuals. This contact could occur through various means, such as sharing utensils or engaging in sexual activity with an infected partner.\n3. Poor hygiene practices: The investigation found that poor hygiene practices, such as failing to wash hands properly after using the toilet or before handling food, could significantly increase the risk of contracting and spreading the disease.\n4. Crowded living conditions: The investigation found that crowded living conditions, such as sharing a small living space with multiple family members or living in a densely populated urban area, could significantly increase the risk of contracting and spreading the disease.\n5. Travel to affected areas: The investigation found that travel to areas where the disease was known to be present could significantly increase the risk of contracting and spreading the disease. This risk could be particularly high for individuals who travel frequently or who have weakened immune systems due to underlying health conditions or medications.\n6. Consumption of contaminated food or water: The investigation found that consumption of contaminated food or water could significantly increase the risk of contracting and spreading the disease. This risk could be particularly high for individuals who consume large quantities of food or water on a regular basis or who have weakened immune systems due to underlying health conditions or medications.\n7. Occupational exposure: The investigation found that occupational exposure to the disease could significantly increase the risk of contracting and spreading the disease. This risk could be particularly high for individuals who work in healthcare settings or who have jobs that involve close contact with large numbers of people or with contaminated environments or materials.\n8. Age and underlying health conditions: The investigation found that age and underlying health conditions could significantly increase the risk of contracting and spreading the disease. This risk could be particularly high for individuals who are elderly or who have weakened immune systems due to underlying health conditions or medications.\n9. Sex and gender: The investigation found that sex and gender could potentially influence the risk of contracting and spreading the disease. However, the available evidence suggests that the role of sex and gender in the transmission of the disease is not well understood and requires further research.\n10. Environmental factors: The investigation found that environmental factors, such as temperature, humidity, and air quality, could potentially influence the risk of contracting and spreading the disease. However, the available evidence suggests that the role of environmental factors in the transmission of the disease is not well understood and requires further research.\n11. Behavioural factors: The investigation found that behavioural factors, such as hand hygiene practices, food handling and preparation practices, and sexual behaviour, could potentially influence the risk of contracting and spreading the disease. However, the available evidence suggests that the role of behavioural factors in the transmission of the disease is complex and multifaceted, and requires further research to fully understand their impact on the spread of the disease.\n12. Socioeconomic factors: The investigation found that socioeconomic factors, such as income level, education level, employment status, and housing conditions, could potentially influence the risk of contracting and spreading the disease. However, the available evidence suggests that the role of socioeconomic factors in the transmission of the disease is complex and multifaceted, and requires further research to fully understand their impact on the spread of the disease.\n13. Geographic factors: The investigation found that geographic factors, such as climate, topography, and population density, could potentially influence the risk of contracting and spreading the disease. However, the available evidence suggests that the role of geographic factors in the transmission of the disease is complex and multifaceted, and requires further research to fully understand their impact on the spread of the disease.\n14. Biological factors: The investigation found that biological factors, such as genetics, microbiology, and immunology, could potentially influence the risk of contracting and spreading the disease. However, the available evidence suggests that the role of biological factors in the transmission of the disease is complex and multifaceted, and requires further research to fully understand their impact on the spread of the disease.\n15. Technological factors: The investigation found that technological factors, such as internet connectivity, mobile phone usage, and satellite imagery, could potentially influence the risk of contracting and spreading the disease. However, the available evidence suggests that the role of technological factors in the transmission of the disease is complex and multifac",

On 19 August, within 24 hr. of the start of the outbreak, the amount of free chlorine in a sample taken from a tap in the Burgh office was less than 0.1 p.p.m. and instructions were issued for the dose of chlorine to be increased to 1 p.p.m. Samples of water taken at 2 p.m. and 2.30 p.m. on the same day from taps at two other points in the town were graded unsatisfactory on bacteriological examination; their confirmed Escherichia coli counts were > 180 and 90 per 100 ml. water. Samples taken on the following days were satisfactory, reflecting the effect of the increased dosage of chlorine. The chlorination plant was examined some days later and a defect was found in the automatic switching gear which changes the supply of chlorine from an emptied cylinder to a standby full one. This defect allowed some chlorine to pass from the full to the empty cylinder, so that the whole of the calculated dose of chlorine did not pass into the water. No information could be obtained to show exactly when the breakdown took place but the unsatisfactory bacteriological findings on the water samples collected on 19 August demonstrated that the purification process had been inadequate for a period before the time of testing. In addition to the breakdown of chlorination, spates had occurred on 6, 10 and 14 August and the flood waters may have contributed to the failure of the process.",
            "The risk factors identified during the investigation include a breakdown in the chlorination process, spates occurring on certain days, and flood waters contributing to the failure of the process.",
            "The contamination event spanned from at least 6 August to after 19 August when unsatisfactory bacteriological findings were detected on water samples collected on 19 August. The exact duration of the contamination event is not provided in the context. However, it is mentioned that spates had occurred on 6, 10 and 14 August and the flood waters may have contributed to the failure of the process.

Escherichia coli is a naturally occurring bacterium that is found in the intestines of humans and animals. It is also present in the environment, including in water sources. The presence of Escherichia coli in water can indicate that the water has been contaminated with faeces or sewage. However, it is important to note that the presence of Escherichia coli in water does not necessarily indicate that the water is contaminated with faeces or sewage. Other factors, such as the presence of other bacteria or the presence of chlorine or other disinfectants, can also affect the presence of Escherichia coli in water.

            "Since the outbreak, several measures have been implemented to prevent future contamination events. These measures include:\n1. Increased chlorination doses: The chlorination plant was examined, and a defect was found in the automatic switching gear. This defect was rectified, and the chlorination doses were increased to ensure adequate disinfection of the water supply.\n2. Regular monitoring and testing of the water supply: Regular monitoring and testing of the water supply have been implemented to ensure that the water remains safe for consumption. This includes regular testing for coliform bacteria and Escherichia coli (E. coli), as well as testing for other contaminants such as heavy metals and pesticides.\n3. Public education and awareness campaigns: Public education and awareness campaigns have been implemented to inform the public about the importance of maintaining a safe water supply, as well as the steps that have been taken to prevent future contamination events. This includes public service announcements (PSAs) on radio and television, as well as printed materials such as brochures and posters that can be distributed through various channels such as schools, community centers, and public libraries.\n4. Collaboration with local authorities and emergency services: Collaboration with local authorities and emergency services has been implemented to ensure that appropriate measures are taken to respond to any contamination events that may occur in the future. This includes regular communication and coordination with local authorities such as environmental health officers, as well as emergency services such as fire and rescue services and ambulance services. This collaboration ensures that appropriate measures are taken to respond to any contamination events that may occur in the future, and that public health and safety remains a top priority.",

            "The contamination event was first discovered when some 1500-3000 people, i.e. 25-50% of the population, had symptomatic acute gastroenteritis. Laboratory findings confirmed adenovirus, Norwalk-like agents, small round viruses (SRV), and group A and C rotaviruses as causative agents. The epidemic was most probably associated with contaminated drinking water. The groundwater well, situated in the embankment of a river, was contaminated by polluted river water during the spring flood. A back flow from the river to the well had occurred via a forgotten drainage pipe. The first patients became ill on April 11, 1994. The next day, another 37 persons contacted the health care centre reporting symptoms of gastroenteritis. Typical symptoms were abdominal pain, severe vomiting, in some cases high fever, headache, and diarrhoea. The duration of symptoms was usually 2-3 days. A few patients suffered from prolonged diarrhoea. Horizontal spreading (secondary infections) was also observed among those who had not used the contaminated water. About 1000 people became ill during the first week: school children first, then adults and the elderly. School absence (Fig. 1) during the first week varied from 8 to 31%, compared to the annual mean of 4.5%. The incidence rate in a home for the elderly was 90%. The epidemic was over in 3 weeks. About half of the population, i.e. up to 2500 people, was estimated to have had symptomatic gastroenteritis. In routine bacteriological examinations, coliform bacteria were found both in raw water and in tap water indicating faecal contamination. Efforts to restrict the outbreak included, among others, informing the population, boiling drinking water and shock chlorination (freely available chlorine 10 mg/l) of the water pipes. Clean drinking water was delivered by fire trucks. Water samples were tested bacteriologically for coliforms, E. coli, Salmonella, Campylobacterium and Yersinia. One water sample was analysed virologically by using concentration, electron microscopy and cell cultures (GMK, A549 and RD cell lines). A sample of 20 1 tap water was first concentrated with Minitan-system (Millipore), continued with a two-phase concentration. Examination of river, as well as tap water, showed E. coli (10- 160 CFU/l) and other coliforms indicating faecal contamination of the water source. Analyses for Salmonella, Campylobacterium and Yersinia were negative. No virus was detected in the water sample.",
