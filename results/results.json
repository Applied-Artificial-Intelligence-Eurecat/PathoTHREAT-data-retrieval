            "The following details of the investigation were provided:\n\n* Case definition and case investigation: A confirmed case of LD was defined as a person who (1) had radiologically confirmed pneumonia and laboratory evidence of infection with Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 (Lp-1) (i.e., isolation of Lp-1 from respiratory secretions, detection of Lp-1 antigens in urine, or a minimum of a 4-fold increase [to 128] in antibody titers to Lp-1), (2) became ill between 1 November 2003 and 31 January 2004, and (3) lived in or visited Harnes or its neighboring communes during the 10 days before the illness. Persons who had been hospitalized or traveling continuously outside of the community during the 10 days before the illness were excluded.\n* Matched case-control study: On 15 January 2004, a matched case-control study was initiated to identify risk factors related to personal characteristics, activities, and potential exposure to contaminated aerosols. Confirmed cases living in communes where at least 2 cases had been identified were included in the study. Controls were randomly selected from the municipal electoral list. Three controls were matched to each case, according to commune of residence, age (10-year groups), and sex.\n* Environmental investigation: Household water from cases' homes was systematically sampled. Locations of CTs and other industrial cooling systems in the epidemic zone were obtained from a census performed by the local environmental authority. Site inspections, record reviews, and water sampling were performed on these installations, as well as on other potential sources of contamination. These included municipal portable water systems, wastewater treatment plants, wells, canals, decorative fountains, air-conditioning systems in public buildings, car-wash stations, and other installations/devices capable of aerosol dissemination. Preventive decontamination was subsequently performed on installations that had levels of Legionella bacteria >100 cfu/L. Weekly control sample collection was performed on all CTs until 15 February. Air samples were collected using a prototype of microbial air sampler (Cyclone; CSTB).\n* Microbiological investigation: Diagnostic tests at the local hospitals included a urinary antigen test for Lp-1 (Now Legionella; Binax) [21], culture, and an indirect immunofluorescence test for serum antibody against L. pneumophila [22]. Legionella bacteria were isolated from environmental samples in accordance with the standard AFNOR NFT90-431 procedure [23] and were identified to the species and serogroup level by direct immunofluorescence and random amplified polymorphic DNA polymerase chain reaction [24]. All clinical and environmental isolates of Lp-1 and a selection of environmental isolates of L. pneumophila serogroups 2-15 were analyzed using the pulsed-field gel electrophoresis-SfiI method [25].\n* Modeling of aerosol dispersion: A Gaussian dispersion model, ADMS 3 [26], was used to simulate the dispersion of presumably infectious aerosols from the CTs of plant A. The flat topography of the area allowed the model to simulate the aerosol dispersion on a horizontal scale over the epidemic zone on the basis of the following parameters: the emission parameters of plant A (including CT configuration, capacity, mode of function, and cleaning operations) and hourly meteorological data during the corresponding period (temperature, humidity, nebulosity, and wind speed and direction). Geographical information systems analysis was performed in ArcMap (version 8.3; ESRI).",

The bloom accumulated at the shoreline near the water plant's intake, causing contamination of the drinking water. The severity of the contamination was attributed to excessive nutrient enrichment, but a multi-annual warming trend extended the bloom period and amplified its severity. The management action of diverting water from the nearby Yangtze River exacerbated the problem by transporting the bloom into the intake. The contaminated drinking water affected approximately 2 million people who regularly use the city's water supply.",

On inspection after the outbreak, the spring was found to be under the influence of surface water; a large pool of water was found in the area over the water collection pipes, probably the result of a late snow melt combined with heavy rains and ground water outfalls.",

            "The contamination event occurred on Friday, April 15th, 1994, when an unusual taste and odour was detected in the drinking water supply in Worcester, England. The local water company received a significant increase in complaints from the public, and initial testing revealed low concentrations of organic chemical contaminants in the consumer drinking water leaving the water treatment works at Barbourne in Worcester. The affected area included Worcester city and nearby towns and villages, with an estimated 160,000 people living in the area. The public was advised not to drink the water, and emergency bowsers were deployed to provide an alternative water supply. After toxicology advice confirmed that the chemicals were not expected to be harmful to health, the public was advised they could drink the water again on Saturday, April 16th. A total of 111 people reported symptoms over the weekend attributed to use of tap water, mainly nausea and headache.",
