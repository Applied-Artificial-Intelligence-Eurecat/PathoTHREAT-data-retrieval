      "The implementation of treated municipal water systems in the 20th century led to a dramatic decrease in waterborne disease in the United States. However, communities with deficient water systems still experience waterborne outbreaks. In August 2004, we investigated an outbreak of gastroenteritis on South Bass Island, Ohio, an island of 900 residents that is visited by 1500,000 persons each year. To prevent future contamination events, the following measures were implemented:\n\n1. Cross-connections from auxiliary wells to the municipal water supply were identified and eliminated by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency.\n2. Sixty (76%) of 79 private wells on the island tested positive for total coliforms, and 24 (30%) of 79 tested positive for E. coli. As a result, all private wells were connected to the municipal water supply.\n3. Seventeen (100%) of 17 businesses with noncommunity public wells had water samples that tested positive for total coliforms, and 12 businesses had samples that tested positive for E. coli. As a result, all noncommunity public wells were connected to the municipal water supply.\n4. The environmental assessment demonstrated that contamination of the karst aquifer beneath the island had occurred from multiple land uses such as onsite septic systems, land application of septage, infiltration of land run-off, and, possibly, a direct hydraulic connection with Lake Erie. As a result, measures were taken to improve the management of wastewater and reduce the risk of contamination from these sources.",

      "The contamination event occurred between midday on Monday 6 March and late evening on Friday 10 March, 1995.",
      "The contamination event took place in a village in Fife, Scotland.",
      "The contamination event described in the text occurred when a local vegetable processor pumped untreated water from a nearby stream into its plant, which was connected to the village's main water supply through a broken pump. This resulted in the contamination of the village's water supply with faecal coliforms, Campylobacter, and E. coli 0157. The incident occurred between midday on Monday 6 March and late evening on Friday 10 March, during which time approximately 320 cubic meters of contaminated water were pumped back into the mains supply.",
      "The initial cause of the contamination event was a broken pump used to draw water from a local vegetable processor's borehole, which resulted in the pumping of contaminated water into the mains supply of the village.",
      "The origin of the contamination was identified as a local vegetable processor a few hundred meters to the east of the village, which was pumping water from a stream downstream from the village's sewage outflow into its plant.",
      "The contamination event was first discovered when residents in the east of the village complained of discoloration of tap water on Friday 10 March 1995.",
      "According to the survey, 127 residents gave salivary samples and were successfully interviewed during July 1995. Of these, 63 had been exposed to the contaminated water and 14 were hospitalized as a result.",
      "The number of people who fell ill due to the event was 711.",
      "The attack rate for this outbreak was approximately 711/633 = 0.112 or 11.2%.",

      "The symptoms associated with the contamination were diarrhoea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.",
      "The initial actions taken to investigate or inspect the event included:\n\n* Chemical analysis of village mains water samples taken on 10 March indicated groundwater contamination.\n* Bacteriological analysis from water samples within the village showed over 1000 total and faecal coliforms from a site in zone I close to its junction with zones 2 and 3.\n* Samples from the stream at the abstraction point grew between 21 000 and 25 400 total coliforms and between 14 100 and 17 600 faecal coliforms per 100 ml.",
      "The investigation included a review of the water treatment process, sampling of the raw water source, and testing for bacterial contaminants such as E. coli, Salmonella, and Campylobacter. The investigation also involved collecting information on the pumping station's operation and maintenance history, as well as interviewing plant operators and other personnel involved in the water treatment process.",
      "The case definition used for the cohort study was a subject who had diarrhoea, vomiting or abdominal pain with first onset between 6 March 1995 and 24 March 1995 inclusive.",
      "The following risk factors were identified during the investigation:\n\n1. Contamination of the public water supply with sewage.\n2. Inadequate communication between the Water and Drainage Division, the Public Health Department, and the affected residents.\n3. Lack of appropriate post-exposure medical treatment for those affected.",
      "The contamination event spanned from approximately midday on Monday 6 March until late evening on Friday 10 March.",
      "Immediate actions taken to mitigate the effects of the contamination included issuing a boiling water notice to each house in the village and providing bowsers at locations throughout the village.",
      "During the monitoring phase, bacteriological analysis of village mains water samples was conducted to determine if there were any changes in the number of total and faecal coliforms present. Specifically, samples were taken on 10 March and analyzed for the presence of these organisms using standard plate count techniques. Additionally, chemical analysis of village mains water samples was performed to detect groundwater contamination.",
      "The post-event analysis revealed the following concentrations of contaminants in the village's water supply:\n\n* Total coliforms: 1000-25400 per 100 ml (zone I) / 0 per 100 ml (zone IV)\n* Faecal coliforms: 14100-17600 per 100 ml (zone I) / 0 per 100 ml (zone IV)\n* Campylobacter: Not detected in routine samples, but present in larger volumes on March 28, 1995 (Penner types 4 and 58)\n* Cryptosporidia: Very low counts (<100 oocysts/100 ml)\n* Giardia lamblia: Very low counts (<100 cysts/100 ml)\n\nNote: The concentrations are expressed in terms of the number of organisms per 100 ml of water.",
      "The restoration actions included flushing out the village's water supply system, increasing the level of disinfection, and providing bowsers at locations throughout the village.",
      "The implementation of a real-time monitoring system for the mains water supply has been proposed to alert authorities in case of any contamination event. Additionally, the Public Health Department of Fife Health Board has advised on the importance of proper maintenance of pumping equipment and regular inspection of boreholes to prevent backflow into the mains supply.",

      "The contamination event described in the text occurred in Montrose, Scotland on August 18-23, 1966. The event involved a breakdown in the water purification process, which resulted in the contamination of the town's water supply with sewage. The breakdown was caused by a defect in the automatic switching gear of the chlorination plant, which allowed some chlorine to pass from the full to the empty cylinder, resulting in an inadequate dose of chlorine being applied to the water. This led to the spread of water-borne gastroenteritis and dysentery throughout the town, with half of the night staff of a large canning factory and one-quarter of the schoolchildren attending the three main schools absent due to illness. There were no deaths reported in the outbreak.",

The outbreak resulted in 8901 cases and 95 deaths, with the majority of cases occurring during the first half of 1997. The investigation found that 27 (93%) of 29 Salmonella Typhi isolates were resistant to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, nalidixic acid, streptomycin, sulfisoxazole, tetracycline, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. The outbreak was linked to contaminated drinking water, with fecal coliform bacteria found in 97% of tap water samples and 100% of wellhead water samples. The water treatment plants were not functioning properly, leading to a decrease in water pressure and an increase in contamination.",
      "The initial cause of the contamination event was fecal coliform contamination in tap water, which occurred due to lack of chlorination, equipment failure, and back-siphonage in the water distribution system.",

Flow-adjusted average concentration of fecal coliforms for water leaving the four treatment plants was 60 cfu/100 mL. The average fecal coliform concentration in water samples taken from household and community taps throughout the city was 175 cfu/100 mL (range, 0 to 1400), triple the calculated concentration in water leaving the plants. This indicates that water contamination increased during passage through the distribution system after water left the treatment plants.",

      "The contamination event was caused by Legionella pneumophila, serogroup 1, subgroup Pontiac la, which was isolated from the cooling water system of one of the air conditioning plants in Stafford District General Hospital. The water in the cooling tower and a chiller unit which cooled the air entering the OPD were contaminated with legionellae.",
      "The investigation revealed faults in the design of the ventilation system, which likely contributed to the contamination event.",
      "The investigation revealed that the chiller unit was most likely to have been the major source of the outbreak.",
      "The contamination event was first discovered when an estimated 136 patients were admitted to the District General Hospital (DGH) with respiratory infections, few with any confirmed diagnosis by 3 May. Two post-mortem lung specimens examined at Birmingham Public Health Laboratory (PHL) yielded organisms which were provisionally identified as Legionella pneumophila, serogroup 1.",
      "According to the text, nearly one third of hospital staff had legionella antibodies, which suggests that approximately 1/3 of the hospital's staff were exposed to the contaminant. As for hospitalization, out of the 68 confirmed inpatient cases, 3 patients developed the illness whilst in hospital.",
      "The number of people who fell ill due to the event was 68.",
      "The attack rate for this outbreak was estimated to be around 30% (68/227).",

Epidemiological investigations to identify the source of infection, including an analysis of patient admissions, staff absenteeism, and environmental samples.\n2. Bacteriological investigations to isolate and identify the bacteria causing the illness, including culturing lung tissue and water samples.\n3. Environmental investigations to identify potential sources of infection, including cooling towers, air conditioning units, and plumbing systems.",
      "The investigators conducted a thorough investigation of the hospital's ventilation system, including the outpatient department (OPD), to identify the source of the Legionella pneumophila bacteria. They found that the cooling water system of one of the air conditioning plants was contaminated with legionellae, and an aerosol containing the bacteria could have been generated in the U-trap below the chiller unit. The investigators also identified faults in the design of the ventilation system that may have contributed to the outbreak.",
      "The case definition used for the cohort study was patients who had either pneumonia or acute lower respiratory tract infection and where there was laboratory evidence of one of the following: (i) culture of L. pneumophila from post-mortem lung, (ii) a fourfold rise in titre of legionella antibodies to 64 or greater using the immunofluorescent antibody test (IFAT), (iii) a single, reproducible IFAT titre of 128, (iv) an IFAT titre of 64 on two occasions, or (v) the staining of legionella organisms by direct immunofluorescence microscopy on post-mortem lung.",
      "The following risk factors were identified during the investigation:\n\n1. Visiting the hospital during April 1985.\n2. Working in areas of the hospital ventilated by the contaminated air conditioning plant.\n3. Having legionella antibodies.",
      "The contamination event spanned from April 1985 to May 1985, a total of one month.",
      "Immediate actions taken to mitigate the effects of the contamination included:\n\n* Boiling of water for drinking and cooking was advised\n* Water supply was stopped to the affected areas\n* Chlorination of the cooling tower water was carried out\n\nNote: The text does not provide information on any other mitigation steps that may have been taken.",
      "The following types of water analyses were performed during the monitoring phase:\n\n1. Culture for Legionella pneumophila.\n2. Quantitative detection of Legionella pneumophila by immunofluorescent antibody testing (IFAT).",
      "The post-event analysis detected Legionella pneumophila, serogroup 1, at a concentration of 10^5 CFU/mL in the cooling water system of one of the air conditioning plants.",
      "The restoration actions included:\n\n1. Isolation of the affected areas, including the OPD, to prevent further spread of the bacteria.\n2. Decontamination of the cooling tower and chiller unit using a disinfectant solution.\n3. Replacement of the cooling tower and chiller unit with new, bacteria-free equipment.\n4. Implementation of additional ventilation measures to improve air quality in the hospital.\n5. Training for staff on proper infection control procedures.\n6. Monitoring of patients and staff for signs of legionellosis.",
      "The investigation revealed faults in the design of the ventilation system, including a lack of adequate filtration and cooling tower maintenance. As a result, control measures were implemented, including the installation of high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters, regular cleaning and disinfection of cooling towers, and monitoring of water temperatures and flow rates in the hospital's air conditioning system. Additionally, staff training was provided on proper infection control practices, including proper use of personal protective equipment (PPE) and proper handling of patient samples.",

The objectives of the investigation were to characterize the agent, describe the persons affected, identify the source of infection, and formulate practical recommendations for control. Four of the six rectal swabs grew V. cholerae El Tor O1, serotype Ogawa. To summarize, more safer, protected wells will be needed in Orissa and in India to control cholera in the longer term. Standardized indicators of the millennium will allow monitoring progress towards these objectives in the future. The broader use of field epidemiology methods should also help us track the various modes of transmission of cholera in the country so that all modes of transmission are addressed with adapted, evidence-based interventions.",

      "The contamination event occurred in May 2007.",
      "The contamination event took place at Gonghu Bay, Lake Taihu, approximately 20 km from Wuxi.",
      "The drinking water crisis in Wuxi, China in 2007 was caused by a massive bloom of toxin-producing cyanobacteria Microcystis spp. in Lake Taihu, which is the city's sole water supply. The bloom accumulated at the shoreline near the water plant's intake, causing the water to become contaminated with microcystins and other odor-producing compounds. The contamination event lasted for at least a week and affected approximately 2 million people who relied on the city's water supply.",
      "The text does not provide information on what triggered the onset of the contamination event or outbreak in Wuxi, China's drinking water crisis in 2007.",
      "The origin of the contamination was identified as the northeast part of Gonghu Bay, where the bloom originated from.",
      "The contamination event was first discovered when local residents in Wuxi, China awoke from a warm, humid night to find an intolerable, offensive odor coming from their water taps on May 29, 2007.",

      "The study did not identify any specific pathogens in the collected water samples.",
      "The study reported that residents who consumed contaminated water experienced gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting (Yang et al., 2008).",
      "The initial actions taken to investigate or inspect the event included collecting water samples from around the intake by boat on the afternoon of June 1, 2007.",
      "The investigation included collecting water samples from around the intake by boat on June 1, 2007, which were analyzed for chemical oxygen demand (CODMn), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP) and chlorophyll a (Chl-a). The study also examined the spatial distribution of these parameters in Gonghu Bay on June 3, 2007. Additionally, chemical analysis of agglomerates sampled on June 4, 2007 was conducted to determine the concentrations of odor producing compounds such as dimethyl trisulfide and alkyl sulfide.",
      "The case definition for the cohort study was based on the presence of cyanotoxins, including microcystins, in the drinking water.",
      "The following risk factors were identified during the investigation:\n\n1. Excessive nutrient enrichment\n2. Multi-annual warming trend\n3. Unanticipated negative impacts of water management",
      "The contamination event spanned from May 29, 2007 to June 5, 2007, a total of 7 days.",
      "Immediate actions taken to mitigate the effects of the contamination included issuing a boil water advisory for residents in Wuxi, stopping the intake of water from Lake Taihu, and increasing chlorination levels at the Gonghu Water Works.",
      "The following water analyses were performed during the monitoring phase:\n\n1. Concentrations of chemical oxygen demand (CODMn), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP) and chlorophyll a (Chl-a).\n2. Spatial distributions of CODMn, TN and TP concentration in Gonghu Bay were examined.\n3. Peak concentrations of CODMn, TN and TP were 13.1 mg L-1, 10.6 mg L-1 and 0.54 mg L-1 respectively, about 3-5 times the average concentrations for that time of the year in Taihu (Zhu 2008).\n4. Chemical analysis of agglomerates sampled on June 4, 2007 showed that peak concentrations of the odor producing compounds dimethyl trisulfide and alkyl sulfide were 11 and 399 ng L-1 respectively (Yang and others 2008).\n5. The additional cyanobacterial odor generating metabolites, 2-methyl-iso-borneol and geosmin, were also detected in the agglomerates (Yang and others 2008).",
      "The post-event analysis detected the following concentrations of contaminants in the water samples collected from Gonghu Bay:\n\n* CODMn: 7.7 - 53.6 mgL-1\n* TN: 4.7 - 23.4 mgL-1\n* TP: 0.23 - 1.05 mgL-1\n* Chl-a: 78.3 - 978.5\\u00b5gL-1",
      "The restoration actions included diverting water from the nearby Yangtze River, flushing the lake of the bloom, and increasing the water treatment capacity at the Gonghu Water Works.",
      "The study suggests that long-term management of large lakes like Taihu must consider both human and climatic factors controlling cyanobacterial blooms and their impacts on water supply. This includes reducing nutrient inputs from agricultural and urban runoff, improving wastewater treatment, and implementing adaptive management strategies that can respond to changing environmental conditions.",
