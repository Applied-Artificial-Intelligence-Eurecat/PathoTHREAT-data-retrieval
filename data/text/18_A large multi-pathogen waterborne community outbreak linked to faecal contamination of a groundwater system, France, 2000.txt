A large waterborne outbreak of infection that occurred during August 2000 in a local community in France was investigated initially via a rapid survey of visits to local physicians. A retrospective cohort study was then conducted on a random cluster sample of residents. Of 709 residents interviewed, 202 (28.5%) were definite cases (at least three liquid stools / day or vomiting) and 62 (8.7%) were probable cases (less than three liquid stools / day or abdominal pain). Those who had drunk tap water had a threefold increased risk for illness (95% CI 2.4-4.0). The risk increased with the amount of water consumed (chi-square trend: p < 0.0001). Bacteriological analyses of stools were performed for 35 patients and virological analyses for 24 patients. Campylobacter coli, group A rotavirus and norovirus were detected in 31.5%, 71.0% and 21% of samples, respectively. An extensive environmental investigation concluded that a groundwater source to this community had probably been contaminated by agricultural run-off, and a failure in the chlorination system was identified. This is the first documented waterborne outbreak of infection involving human C. coli infections. A better understanding of the factors influencing campylobacter transmission between hosts is required. On 23 August 2000, a general practitioner (GP) informed the local district health department that 16 cases of acute gastro-enteritis (AGE) had occurred among residents of a holiday camp in the Gourdon community since 21 August. Gourdon, which is located in the south-west of France, has a population of 4888 inhabitants, which increases by 50% in the July-August tourist season. Investigations at the holiday camp concluded that foodborne transmission was very unlikely, but found that tap water was highly contaminated with faecal coliforms. Preliminary information collected from physicians in Gourdon indicated an increase of the number of consultations for AGE.
