In November 2010, ~27,000 (\u224845%) inhabitants of \u00d6stersund, Sweden, were affected by a waterborne outbreak of cryptosporidiosis. The outbreak was characterized by a rapid onset and high attack rate, especially among young and middle-aged persons. Young age, number of infected family members, amount of water consumed daily, and gluten intolerance were identified as risk factors for acquiring cryptosporidiosis. Also, chronic intestinal disease and young age were significantly associated with prolonged diarrhea. Identification of Cryptosporidium hominis subtype IbA10G2 in human and environmental samples and consistently low numbers of oocysts in drinking water confirmed insufficient reduction of parasites by the municipal water treatment plant. The current outbreak shows that use of inadequate microbial barriers at water treatment plants can have serious consequences for public health. This risk can be minimized by optimizing control of raw water quality and employing multiple barriers that remove or inactivate all groups of pathogens. In late November 2010, the County Medical Office in \u00d6stersund received reports from several employers that 10%-20% of employees had gastroenteritis. The office advised that patients with acute gastroenteritis be tested for bacterial, viral, and protozoan pathogens. Among 20 patients from whom samples were obtained, 14 cases of cryptosporidiosis were detected on November 26. To estimate the extent of the outbreak, the municipality published a questionnaire on its website during November 27-December 13, 2010. Persons in \u00d6stersund who had gastrointestinal symptoms were encouraged to provide information about day of onset, home address, and recent food intake. Two months after the outbreak began, we conducted a retrospective cohort study, which included a random sample of 1,524 persons living in \u00d6stersund, to assess the extent of the outbreak, clinical characteristics of infected persons, and risk factors for acquiring cryptosporidiosis. Gastrointestinal symptoms were reported by 10,653 persons over a period of 2.5 weeks, confirming the large outbreak in the city and contamination of the drinking water (Figure 2). The number of cases of gastrointestinal illness increased from mid-November and peaked on November 29, three days after the boil-water advisory was issued. Thereafter, the number of new cases reported per day rapidly declined. Questionnaires were distributed by mail to 1,524 addressees; 10 persons had moved, and 6 were unable to respond. Of the remaining 1,508, a total of 1,044 (69.2%) responded: 481 men (46.1%) and 563 women (53.9%) (median age 44 years [range 0-98 years]) (Table 1). The response rate was highest for women 60-69 years of age (90.0%) and lowest for men 20-29 years (43.8%), and 45.2% (95% CI 42.1%-48.3%) of all the responders met the case definition criteria. Cryptosporidium oocysts were found in drinking water and raw water samples collected at the WTP-\u00d6 on November 27 and in all samples of WTP-\u00d6 drinking water, water from the distribution network, and raw water from Lake Storsj\u00f6n over the next 2 months (Table 5). The highest number of oocysts in drinking water (1.4 presumptive oocysts/10 L) was detected on December 12, 2010 (online Technical Appendix Figure 1. During the outbreak, the average oocyst density in drinking water was 0.32/10 L in WTP-\u00d6 samples and 0.20/10 L in samples from the distribution network. Densities in raw water samples were generally higher: 0.2-3.1 oocysts/10 L. In WWTP-\u00d6 wastewater, the pre-outbreak low density (<200 oocysts/10 L), had increased to 1,800/10 L on November 16, was highest at 270,000/10 L on November 29, and then gradually declined to preoutbreak levels from December 31 onward (online Technical Appendix Figure 2). Oocysts were detected in 4 of 22 raw water samples from other municipalities near Lake Storsj\u00f6n but in only 1 drinking water sample from a WTP (online Technical Appendix Table). All samples of untreated wastewater, most samples of treated wastewater (11/18), and samples from recipient water bodies (6/9) contained oocysts. Failure of the WTP-\u00d6 and onset of the outbreak has several plausible explations. To our knowledge, no posttreatment contamination or extensive failures in the treatment processes occurred, and routine tests of the drinking water showed no increased levels of fecal indicator bacteria. The WTP-\u00d6 had 2 microbiological barriers (ozonation and chloramination) as recommended by the drinking water regulations in Sweden for surface waterworks, but these barriers were simply inadequate to remove or inactivate the Cryptosporidium oocysts in the raw water. The long-term solution to reduce infective parasites in \u00d6stersund was to install a UV water disinfection system, which was done after the outbreak in December 2010. In addition, pipes were repeatedly flushed, and and further sampling was conducted to verify that no potentially viable oocysts remained in the distribution network.
