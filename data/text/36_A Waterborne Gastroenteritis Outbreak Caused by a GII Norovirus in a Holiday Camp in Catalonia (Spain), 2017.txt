On 2 February 2017, Epidemiological Surveillance Services were notified of an outbreak of acute gastroenteritis (AGE) among schoolchildren who had taken part of a school trip from 30 January to 3 February 2017 at a holiday camp in Catalonia. A retrospective cohort study was performed to identify the causative agent, estimate the magnitude of the outbreak and identify its source, as well as to determine the route of transmission. Data collected by standardised questionnaires identified 41 episodes of AGE among 174 individuals who attended the camp. Cases had mainly symptoms of abdominal pain (73.8%), nausea (64.3%), vomiting (54.8%), diarrhoea (45.2%) and headache (42.9%). Consumption of water was associated with gastroenteritis (crude RR: 1.72, 95%CI: 1.01\u20132.92; adjusted RR: 1.88, 95%CI 1.03\u20133.56). NoV GII was detected in faeces (5 out of 13) and water samples. Additionally, faecal indicator bacteria and protozoa were detected in water samples. The outbreak showed a high attack rate and was caused by a natural water fountain not properly treated and not monitored for safety quality. There could have been a discharge of wastewater at a point close to the fountain; however, the source of contamination of the water could not be identified. Health education may be useful to eliminate risks associated with the consumption of untreated water from natural fountains. A retrospective cohort study was carried out among 174 participants of a school trip, to estimate the magnitude of the outbreak and to identify its source, as well as to study symptomatology, attack rates and relative risks. The study population consisted of individuals attending a private subsidised School in Barcelona, Spain, and who had taken part of a school trip to a holiday camp in Avi\u00e0 (Bergued\u00e0 County, Catalonia, Spain) from 30 January to 3 February 2017. Epidemiological investigation included standardised questionnaires about sex, age, class, risk exposures and illness characteristics. Stool samples and environmental water samples were analysed for the presence of bacteria and viruses. On 2 February 2017, the Epidemiological Surveillance and Response to Public Health Emergencies Service of the Public Health Agency of Catalonia was informed of several cases of AGE at a school trip. The school director reported that five students had become ill from 31 January to 2 February with nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and abdominal pain during the holiday camp in Avi\u00e0. A viral aetiology was suspected because incubation periods, clinical syndromes and the duration of the illness. Of 174 individuals exposed (164 schoolchildren and 10 teachers), 64 participants returned the questionnaire (response rate 36.8%). The mean age of the participants was 13.7 years, and 29.7% were female. Two secondary cases were identified and were excluded from the analysis, as they did not meet the inclusion criteria. One case was a household contact who did not attend the camp and, the second case was a food handler, who was asymptomatic and with NoV stool sample negative, which turned out to be positive 14 days afterwards. The onset of symptoms was between 31 January in the early morning in the first case and 4 February at noon in the last case (Figure 1). Cases had mainly symptoms of abdominal pain (73.8%), nausea (64.3%), vomiting (54.8%), diarrhoea (45.2%) and headache (42.9%). In this case, 41 individuals met the case definition; some students required health assistance, but none of them were submitted to the hospital. The attack rate was 64.1% (41/64). The overall prevalence of water consumption was 53.1%. The multivariate analysis indicated that all subjects who drank water from the natural fountain had a significant increased risk of developing gastroenteritis compared with those who did not (adjusted relative risk 1.88, 95% CI: 1.03\u20133.56) (Table 1).  NoV GII was detected in five of 13 faecal samples by RT-qPCR. Within laboratory examination, GII.P16_GII.2 genotype was identified in the sequence analysis. In addition, water samples tested positive for faecal indicator bacteria, coliforms and Escherichia coli, negative for Clostridium perfringens and enterococci (Table 2). RT-qPCR tests for NoV GII were also positive in the water. However, no sequence analysis was performed in the water samples, due to their low viral loads.
