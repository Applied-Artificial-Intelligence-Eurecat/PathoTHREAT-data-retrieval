Approximately 3000 people in Bennington, Vermont, 19% of the population, had a diarrheal illness during the first and second weeks of June 1978. Persons affected reported abdominal cramps (86%), diarrhea (82%), malaise (73%), and headache (47%). The mean duration of illness was 4.6 days. The illness was associated with drinking unboiled water from the town water system. Investigation showed that the entire water system was probably contaminated and the source of contamination was the main unfiltered water source, Bolles Brook. Campylobacter fetus subspecies jejuni was cultured from 15 of 4 2 rectal swabs obtained from persons who had been ill, but not from swabs obtained from 23 persons who served as controls. No environmental samples of water and no specimens from wild or domestic animals were positive for Campylobacter. This appears to be the first waterborne outbreak of gastroenteritis associated with C. fetus subspecies jejuni. Bennington's single water distribution system was constructed in the early 1900s. Widespread bacteriologic contamination attributed to inadequate chlorination occurred three times in the water system in the fall of 1977. Notices to boil water had been issued by the State Health Department in 1977. Some Bennington residents continued to boil their home water or refrained from using unboiled water before and at the time of the 1978 outbreak. A household survey (Survey 1), using a cluster sampling design was done from 15 to 19 June. Persons in households were initially surveyed through door-to-door interviews; those who could not be interviewed using this technique were contacted by phone.
