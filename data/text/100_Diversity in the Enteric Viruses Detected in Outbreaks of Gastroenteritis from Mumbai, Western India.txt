Faecal specimens collected from two outbreaks of acute gastroenteritis that occurred in southern Mumbai, India in March and October, 2006 were tested for seven different enteric viruses. Among the 218 specimens tested, 95 (43.6%) were positive, 73 (76.8%) for a single virus and 22 (23.2%) for multiple viruses. Single viral infections in both, March and October showed predominance of enterovirus (EV, 33.3% and 40%) and rotavirus A (RVA, 33.3% and 25%). The other viruses detected in these months were norovirus (NoV, 12.1% and 10%), rotavirus B (RVB, 12.1% and 10%), enteric adenovirus (AdV, 6.1% and 7.5%), Aichivirus (AiV, 3% and 7.5%) and human astrovirus (HAstV, 3% and 0%). Mixed viral infections were largely represented by two viruses (84.6% and 88.9%), a small proportion showed presence of three (7.7% and 11%) and four (7.7% and 0%) viruses in the two outbreaks. Genotyping of the viruses revealed predominance of RVA G2P[4], RVB G2 (Indian Bangladeshi lineage), NoV GII.4, AdV-40, HAstV-8 and AiV B types. VP1/2A junction region based genotyping showed presence of 11 different serotypes of EVs. Although no virus was detected in the tested water samples, examination of both water and sewage pipelines in gastroenteritis affected localities indicated leakages and possibility of contamination of drinking water with sewage water. Coexistence of multiple enteric viruses during the two outbreaks of gastroenteritis emphasizes the need to expand such investigations to other parts of India. The number of gastroenteritis cases admitted to the pediatric and adult wards of GTH and JJH in the previous year was also recorded. Any inhabitant of the gastroenteritis affected localities, admitted for \u22653 loose or watery stools a day with or without vomiting, fever and abdominal pain at GTH during 13th-26th March (11-12 weeks), 2006 and at JJH during 5th-15th October (40-41 weeks), 2006 was considered an outbreak case. Faecal specimens were collected from 72 (30 children \u226410 years, 5 adolescents aged 11-17 years and 37 adults \u226518 years) and 146 (61 children \u226410 years, 6 adolescents aged 11-17 years and 79 adults \u226518 years) patients hospitalized at GTH and JJH, respectively, during the outbreak periods. Two outbreaks of acute gastroenteritis were reported in the months of March and October 2006, respectively, from two and one localities of southern Mumbai. The outbreak affected localities, each 1-1.5 km2 in area that was occupied by 4500 and 7000 inhabitants respectively. Nearly 7% and 4% of the inhabitants were affected by the disease, respectively, during the months of March and October, 2006. In order to establish the incidence of gastroenteritis outbreaks, the number of gastroenteritis cases admitted monthly to GTH and JJH was recorded for the year, 2006.
