A presumably waterborne outbreak of Campylobacter jejuni/coli infection in a subarctic community is described. Drinking water supplied to residents was delivered unchlorinated during a 4-week period. No Campylobacter sp. was recovered from the water supply. Three hundred thirty individuals (15% of the 2200 exposed) became ill. Diarrhoea, abdominal pain, fever, nausea and joint pain occurred in 81%, 30%, 29%, 43% and 21%, respectively. Nine percent reported swelling of joints, and two cases of reactive arthritis occurred. A Campylobacter sp. was isolated from 9 of 33 individuals who became ill and from 1 of 33 healthy controls. All culture-positive individuals, 46% of culture-negative ill persons and 27% of healthy controls were seropositive. All strains recovered had an identical DNA profile. The water source of this community is a river on which a dam has been built. Thus, surface water served as drinking water common to 2200 of the inhabitants in the community. During the summer of 1988, the rinsing system (chlorination) was to be renewed and the water was delivered unchlorinated for a period of approximately 4 weeks. During this period, the community health officers were faced with increased morbidity presenting as gastrointestinal illness. Questionnaires were returned from 520 (17%) of the 3085 inhabitants to whom they were sent. Seventy-seven (15%) of the 520 respondents, all consumers of the common drinking water supply, became ill. Among those who reported using only boiled tap water during the epidemic, no illness was recorded.
