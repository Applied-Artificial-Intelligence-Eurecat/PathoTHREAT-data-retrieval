Purpose Outbreaks of Campylobacter infection are common, but studies exploring the clinical features of acute illness in the outbreak setting are scarce in existing literature. The main purpose of the present study was to investigate the clinical features of self-reported acute illness in gastroenteritis cases during a large waterborne Campylobacter outbreak in Ask\u00f8y municipality, Norway, in 2019. A web-based self-administered questionnaire, and invitation to participate was sent by the municipality of Ask\u00f8y as text message to mobile phones using the municipality\u2019s warning system to the inhabitants during the ongoing outbreak. Out of 3624 participants, 749 (20.7%) were defined as cases, of which 177 (23.6%) reported severe gastroenteritis. The most common symptoms were loose stools (90.7%), abdominal pain (89.3%) and diarrhea (88.9%), whereas 63.8% reported fever, 50.2% joint pain and 14.2% bloody stools. Tiredness, a symptom non-specific to gastroenteritis, was the overall most common symptom (91.2%). About one in four of the cases reported symptoms consistent with severe gastroenteritis. We found more joint pain and less bloody stools than reported in published studies of laboratory confirmed campylobacteriosis cases. Tiredness was common in the current study, although rarely described in previous literature of acute illness in the outbreak setting. In June 2019, there was a large community-wide waterborne Campylobacter outbreak in the island municipality Ask\u00f8y (population 29,500) in Norway. The outbreak was detected on 6 June 2019, and the outbreak investigation team consisting of the municipality of Ask\u00f8y and the National Institute of Public Health\u2019s (NIPH) later concluded that the drinking water had been contaminated by Campylobacter jejuni sometime in late May 2019 [28]. The outbreak investigation findings were published in a report stating that more than 1500 inhabitants were ill during the outbreak [28]. Further, 67 patients were admitted to hospital and 2 deaths were related to the outbreak [28, 29]. Our group has long experience with research on clinical manifestations and complications of gastroenteritis in an outbreak setting [30, 31] and established a large cohort study within days after the outbreak was acknowledged. The primary aim of this study was to describe the clinical features of self-reported acute gastroenteritis in a Campylobacter outbreak setting. Secondary aims were to investigate factors associated with severe gastroenteritis.
