In September 2001, a waterborne outbreak of gastroenteritis occurred in eastern France. Of 31 fecal samples from symptomatic individuals, 19 tested positive for Cryptosporidium with two PCRs targeting the Hsp70 and the 18S rRNA genes of Cryptosporidium. Sequencing of the PCR fragments produced sequences identical to that of Cryptosporidium parvum genotype 1. The outbreak investigated in the present paper occurred in 2001 in Dracy le Fort, a county of 1,100 inhabitants in eastern France. On 20 September, health authorities were notified of clustered cases of gastroenteritis. Investigations showed that gastroenteritis cases and complaints about the water quality had been reported by a population served by the same water network since 14 September. Contamination of the public water supply was thus suspected, and an outbreak was declared on 20 September. Cryptosporidium oocysts were identified in water samples collected from the public network in Dracy le Fort on 27 September. Epidemiologic investigations conducted by public health authorities showed that an estimated 563 individuals presented gastroenteritis symptoms (attack rate, 50.8%). The clinical incidence of patients presenting with diarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal pain spanned a long period. Consumption of tap water before 20 September was the only risk factor associated with the clinical symptoms.
