Background: In February 2009, a group of Guatemalan school children developed acute gastroenteritis (AGE) after participating in a school excursion. Objectives: We conducted a retrospective cohort investigation to characterize the outbreak and guide control measures. Study design: A case was defined as an illness with onset of diarrhea or vomiting during February 25-March 5, 2009. Participants were interviewed using a standardized questionnaire, and stool specimens were collected. We inspected the excursion site and tested water samples for total coliforms and Escherichia coli. Results: We identified 119 excursion participants, of which 92 (77%) had been ill. Fifty-six (62%) patients sought care for their illness, and three (3%) were hospitalized. Eighteen (90%) of the 20 specimens from ill children tested positive for norovirus. Among these, 16 (89%) were of the genogroup I (GI.7) and two (11%) were genogroup II (GII.12 and GII.17). One (8%) of the 12 food handlers had norovirus (GI.7). Drinking water samples had 146 most probable numbers (MPN)/100 ml of total coliforms and five MPN/100 ml of E. coli. Conclusion: We describe the first laboratory-confirmed norovirus outbreak in Guatemala. The high illness attack rate, detection of multiple norovirus strains in sick persons, and presence of fecal contamination of drinking water indicate likely waterborne transmission. On March 3, 2009, the Guatemalan Ministry of Public Health and Welfare and the CDC\u2019s Global Disease Detection Program in Guatemala received a report of a large outbreak of AGE among participants in a school excursion to a Guatemalan resort. On February 25, 2009, a group of first-grade school children from Guatemala City and accompanying adult parents and teachers, participated in a three-day excursion outside of Guatemala City. The excursion took place in an agrotourism resort complex in Tecpan, located approximately 40 km west of Guatemala City. We interviewed 119 persons, of which 92 (77%) met the primary case definition. Among those ill, 81 (88%) were children and 11 (12%) were accompanying adults. The median age of the ill children was seven years (range: 6-8 years). Fifty-four (59%) of those ill were female. In terms of clinical presentation, symptoms reported among the ill were diarrhea (80%), vomiting (53%), nausea (51%), fever (36%), and abdominal cramps (29%); 45 (49%) reported diarrhea as their first symptom, 40 (44%) had vomiting as their initial symptom, and six (7%) had both. Two (2%) ill persons reported having bloody stools. Fifty-six (62%) patients sought medical care for their illness, and three (3%) were hospitalized. Among the ill children, 17 (21%) took an antimicrobial to treat the illness, and 33 (59%) received an oral rehydration solution. Among the food items consumed during the excursion, specific attack rates ranged from 69% to 81%, but none of the food items was significantly associated with illness (Table 1). The attack rates among persons who participated in the resort activities ranged from 77% to 80%, but none was significantly associated with illness (Table 2). We collected 20 stool specimens from ill children of which 18 (90%) tested positive for norovirus. Among these, 16 (89%) were positive for GI, genotyped as GI.7 and two (11%) were positive for GII, and were further characterized as GII.12 and GII.17. Two (10%) samples grew Campylobacter jejuni, and none tested positive for rotavirus or intestinal parasites. None of the food handlers reported being ill before, during, or after the excursion took place. Among 12 specimens from food handlers, one (8%) tested positive for norovirus GI (GI.7).
