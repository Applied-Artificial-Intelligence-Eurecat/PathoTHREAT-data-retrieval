Cryptosporidium, a parasite known to cause large drinking and recreational water outbreaks, is tolerant of chlorine concentrations used for drinking water treatment. Human laboratory-based surveillance for enteric pathogens detected a cryptosporidiosis outbreak in Baker City, Oregon during July 2013 associated with municipal drinking water. Objectives of the investigation were to confirm the outbreak source and assess outbreak extent. The watershed was inspected and city water was tested for contamination. To determine the community attack rate, a standardized questionnaire was administered to randomly sampled households. Weighted attack rates and confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Water samples tested positive for Cryptosporidium species; a Cryptosporidium parvum subtype common in cattle was detected in human stool specimens. Cattle were observed grazing along watershed borders; cattle faeces were observed within watershed barriers. The city water treatment facility chlorinated, but did not filter, water. The community attack rate was 28\u00b73% (95% CI 22\u00b71-33\u00b76), sickening an estimated 2780 persons. Watershed contamination by cattle probably caused this outbreak; water treatments effective against Cryptosporidium were not in place. This outbreak highlights vulnerability of drinking water systems to pathogen contamination and underscores the need for communities to invest in system improvements to maintain multiple barriers to drinking water contamination. Initial interviews of confirmed case patients identified no common exposures, and no travel outside of the county was reported. BCHD staff also reported hearing many anecdotal reports of cryptosporidiosis-compatible illnesses from Baker City residents distributed throughout the city. The lack of other common exposures suggested drinking water was the likely source. On 31 July, a boil-water advisory was issued, and public health officials initiated an investigation. Of 50 presumptively ill persons (25\u00b71% of surveyed population), 27 (54%) were female; median age was 49 (range 2-89) years; and six (12%) had an immunodeficiency. Symptom onset ranged from 1 July (4 weeks before the outbreak was detected) to 10 August (Fig. 2). Median symptom duration was 6 (range 3-50) days. Ten (20%) persons had sought medical care; three (6%) had sought treatment at an emergency department; and three (6%) had been admitted to a hospital. However, none had laboratory-confirmed cryptosporidiosis. The weighted attack rate was 28\u00b73% [95% confidence interval (CI) 22\u00b71-33\u00b76]. On the basis of Baker City\u2019s 2010 census, \u223c2780 persons became ill during the outbreak. Presumptive cryptosporidiosis was not significantly associated with sex, age, or daily tap water consumption (Table 1).
