Salmonella Paratyphi A (SPA) is rapidly becoming a common cause of enteric fever in South East Asia. A large outbreak of SPA occurred in a boarding middle school in China in 2004. There were 394 suspected cases; 95.5% were students. The highest incidence was in the youngest children (7th grade). Forty-four of 151 (29%) blood cultures and 4/54 (7.4%) rectal swabs were positive for SPA; three were from kitchen workers. The geometric mean levels of serum IgG antilipopolysaccharide (anti-LPS) from patients was higher than from healthy individuals [35.25 vs. 5.20 ELISA units (EU), P<0.001]. A kitchen worker with a positive rectal swab, negative blood culture and a high level of serum IgG anti-LPS (529.65 EU), was identified as a possible SPA carrier. No SPA was isolated from water or food samples. A survey of students\u2019 habits indicated drinking unboiled water as being the main reason for contracting the disease. Hand washing was the second most important factor. A food handler with possible SPA carriage could also have been a risk factor. Attention to maintaining a 
safe water supply, enhancing food-handler hygiene and proper hand washing can help to prevent similar outbreaks in the future. A suspected case was defined as a person at Lingtian Middle School having one of the following clinical symptoms during 23 November to 7 December: fever (oral temperature \u226537.7 \u00b0C, duration \u226524 h), diarrhoea, headache, sore throat, general malaise, anorexia, coughing, abdominal pain, or chill and 
with positive Widal test or with a positive blood culture. According to the Chinese Epidemiology Guideline 1996 those with a positive Widal test and having fever >3 days were identified as confirmed SPA infections. However, due to the large number of cases that oc-curred during the outbreak and the shortage of health staff, the collection of blood samples and clinical symptoms on days 2 and 3 was only undertaken when possible.
