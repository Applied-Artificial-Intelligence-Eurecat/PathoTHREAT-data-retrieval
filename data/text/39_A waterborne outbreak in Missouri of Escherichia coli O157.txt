Objective: To describe and determine the source of a large outbreak of Escherichia coli 0157:H7 (EC0157) infections in Missouri.   Design: A case-control study and a household survey.   Setting: A small city in a rural Missouri township that had an unchlorinated water supply.   Patients: Case patients were residents of or visitors to Burdine Township with bloody diarrhea or diarrhea and abdominal cramps occurring between 15 December 1989 and 20 January 1990.   Measurements: Escherichia coli 0157 was isolated from 21 stool specimens. All isolates were resistant to sulfisoxazole, tetracycline, and streptomycin; produced Shiga-like toxins I and II; and had one 60-megadalton plasmid.   Results: Among the 243 case patients, 86 had bloody stools, 32 were hospitalized, 4 died, and 2 had the hemolytic uremic syndrome. In the case-control study, no food was associated with illness, but ill persons had drunk more municipal water than had controls (P = 0.04). The survey showed that, during the peak of the outbreak, bloody diarrhea was 18.2 times more likely to occur in persons living inside the city and using municipal water than in persons living outside the city and using private well water (P= 0.001). Shortly before the peak of the outbreak, 45 water meters were replaced, and two water mains ruptured. The number of new cases declined rapidly after residents were ordered to boil water and after chlorination of the water supply.   Conclusions: This was the largest outbreak of EC0157 infections, the first due to a multiply resistant organism, and the first shown to be transmitted by water. System-wide chlorination as well as hyperchlorination during repairs might have prevented this outbreak. Both bloody and nonbloody diarrhea may be common manifestations of this infection, which is probably underdiagnosed because of the failure of routine stool cultures to identify the organism. Cities with deteriorating water systems using untreated water risk widespread illness from contaminated drinking water. Cabool is a small city in rural southern Missouri within Burdine Township. The township has 3126 inhabitants, 2090 of whom live within the city limits. The borders of the township extend 6 to 9 miles from the city limits. Between 12 and 24 December 1989, the region experienced extreme cold, with low temperatures that reached -28 \u00b0C (-19 \u00b0F) and that did not exceed 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F). Between 14 and 29 December, 45 inground water meters were replaced because of freezing of lines or meter failure, and two large water mains broke on 23 December and 26 December, respectively (Figure 1). On 4 January 1990, the local health department learned of ten persons in Cabool, including several bedbound nursing home residents, with bloody diarrhea and abdominal cramps. The next day, officials warned residents to boil drinking water. Patients' stool specimens yielded no pathogens using routine culture methods, but an alert laboratory technician isolated ECO 157 using sorbitol-MacConkey culture medium. A case was defined as illness with onset between 15 December 1989 and 20 January 1990 in a visitor or resident of Burdine Township or household contact of a case patient with 1. three or more loose, bloody stools in a 24-hour period or 2. three or more loose, nonbloody stools in a 24-hour period lasting at least 1 day and accompanied by abdominal cramps. To identify case patients, we used media appeals; contacted surrounding physicians, hospitals, and laboratories; and conducted a household survey. Stools were collected for culture from all newly recognized cases of bloody or severe diarrhea. County and state sanitarians inspected the two grocery stores, the six restaurants, and the nursing home kitchen facilities in Cabool; determined their food sources; inspected the municipal water and sewage system; and evaluated possible cross-connections between the water and sewer systems. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) used water-system flow data and the household locations of all known cases of bloody diarrhea inside the city to create a computer model. Scenarios were constructed in which 1 x 109 bacteria were introduced into the water system during a 4-hour period at various sites including the sites of possible breaks in the distribution system. The extent of bacterial spread and sections of the city at highest risk were determined (13). Coliform counts were done on water samples collected in Cabool by the Environmental Bacteriology Unit of the Missouri State Public Health Laboratory (EBMSPHL) using membrane filtration (18). All eight isolates from water samples collected between 8 and 13 January were later replated on SMAC medium. The EPA, Cincinnati, Ohio, did coliform counts on water samples collected from 12 through 15 February using the membrane-filter procedure (18). Between 15 December and 20 January 243 persons had diarrhea that met the case definition. Their mean age was 38 years, and 63% were female. Eighty-six persons (35%) had bloody diarrhea. Residents of Cabool accounted for 68 (80%) of the 86 persons with bloody diarrhea and 73 (46%) of the 157 persons with nonbloody diarrhea. Most cases occurred after the first water meters were replaced and after the two water mains ruptured; cases decreased after an order to boil drinking water and after the water was chlorinated (Figure 2). At a nursing home in Cabool, 10 of 82 residents (12%) were case patients. Three case patients from outside the township were household contacts of other case patients who had been in Cabool during this time period. Attack rates and clinical characteristics of case patients living inside the city were determined. The attack rate was 6.7% (141 of 2090; 95% CI, 5.6% to 7.8%) for all cases and 3.3% (68 of 2090; CI, 2.5% to 4.1%) for bloody diarrhea. For cases with known age, attack rates were: age of less than 5 years, 7.3% (12 of 164 persons; CI, 3.3% to 11.3%); age 5 to 17 years, 5.9% (23 of 387 persons; CI, 3.6% to 8.2%); age 18 to 64, 6.0% (65 of 1078 persons; CI, 4.6% to 7.4%); and age greater than 64, 8.2% (38 of 461 persons; CI, 5.7% to 10.7%). The proportion of case patients with bloody diarrhea was significantly higher for persons over 64 years of age (79%; 30 of 38 cases; CI, 66.1% to 92.0%) than for younger persons (37%; 37 of 100 cases; CI, 27.5% to 46.5%) (P < 0.001, chi square). Clinical characteristics of case patients with bloody and nonbloody stools were similar except patients with bloody diarrhea were more likely to seek medical attention than were those with nonbloody diarrhea and had a higher mean number of stools per day (Table 1). We isolated ECO 157 from 21 (58%) of 36 case patients who submitted stool specimens to the state or the regional laboratory between 5 January and 20 January. The onsets of illness in patients with positive cultures ranged from 27 December to 12 January. Excluding 4 patients with specimens obtained more than 7 days after symptom onset, EC0157 was isolated from 19 of 25 (76%) case patients with bloody diarrhea and from 2 of 7 (29%) with nonbloody diarrhea. Initially, stool cultures were not done on patients with nonbloody diarrhea. No other pathogens were isolated from stool cultures done on residents of Cabool between 15 December and 20 January. The outbreak strain was resistant to sulfisoxazole, tetracycline, and streptomycin but was sensitive to the other antimicrobial agents tested. It produced both SLT I and II and had a single 60-megadalton plasmid. Of the 68 water samples collected between 18 December and 12 January (the day of chlorination) from the wells and distribution system and cultured at the EBMSPHL, 6 had coliform counts of 1 per 100 mL, and 1 had 2 per 100 mL. Federal drinking water regulations in place at the time of this outbreak defined any sample with 1 or more coliforms per 100 mL as unsatisfactory. All eight colonies from these samples were sorbitol positive. Most water samples were collected late in the outbreak. No samples were collected between 19 December and 2 January; only one sample was collected from the distribution system on 18 December and one on 3 January; neither were from the areas with the highest concentration of cases (north and northeast sections).
