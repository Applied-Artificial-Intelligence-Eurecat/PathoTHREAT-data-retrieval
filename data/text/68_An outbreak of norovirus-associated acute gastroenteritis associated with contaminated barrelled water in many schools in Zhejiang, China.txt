More than 900 students and teachers at many schools in Jiaxing city developed acute gastroenteritis in February 2014. An immediate epidemiological investigation was conducted to identify the pathogen, infection sources and route of transmission. The probable cases and confirmed cases were defined as students or teachers with diarrhoea or vomiting present since the term began in February 2014. An active search was conducted for undiagnosed cases among students and teachers. Details such as demographic characteristics, gastrointestinal symptoms, and drinking water preference and frequency were collected via a uniform epidemiological questionnaire. A case-control study was implemented, and odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals were calculated. Rectal swabs from several patients, food handlers and barrelled water factory workers, as well as water and food samples, were collected to test for potential bacteria and viruses. A total of 924 cases fit the definition of the probable case, including 8 cases of laboratory-confirmed norovirus infection at 13 schools in Jiaxing city between February 12 and February 21, 2014. The case-control study demonstrated that barrelled water was a risk factor (OR: 20.15, 95% CI: 2.59\u00b1156.76) and that bottled water and boiled barrelled water were protective factors (OR: 0.31, 95% CI: 0.13\u00b10.70, and OR: 0.36, 95% CI: 0.16\u00b10.77). A total of 11 rectal samples and 8 barrelled water samples were detected as norovirus-positive, and the genotypes of viral strains were the same (GII). The norovirus that contaminated the barrelled water largely came from the asymptomatic workers. This acute gastroenteritis outbreak was caused by barrelled water contaminated by norovirus. The outbreak was controlled after stopping the supply of barrelled water. The barrelled water supply in China represents a potential source of acute gastroenteritis outbreaks due to the lack of surveillance and supervision. Therefore, more attention should be paid to this area. On February 17, 2014, The Center for Disease Control and Prevention of Jiaxing City (JXCDC) was notified that hundreds of students at many schools located in Haining city and Haiyan county (Fig 1) had developed symptoms of diarrhoea and vomiting of unknown cause; the event attracted media attention. We immediately formed a team to conduct an epidemiological investigation to determine the cause of the pathogen, infection sources, route of transmission and risk factors. A total of 924 cases fit the definition of the probable case, including 8 cases of laboratory-confirmed norovirus infection between February 12 and February 21, 2014; the attack rate was 4.01%. Six middle schools in Haining city and 4 middle schools and 3 kindergartens in Haiyan county were involved. The attack rate for students was much higher than that for teachers. The highest and lowest attack rates for students were 10.47% and 1.22%, respectively. The grade and class distributions of the student cases were dispersed; in the schools, almost every grade had cases, with most of those grades having no more than 10 cases. A total of 11 rectal samples and 8 barrelled water samples were detected as norovirus-positive. The genotypes of the viral strains were the same (GII) in the patients and in the barrelled water. The JXCDC used immediate control measures, including surveillance, disinfection and prohibition of the barrelled water supply, to stop this outbreak (Fig 2). The 924 cases included 919 students and 5 teachers (Table 1). The 919 student cases included 420 boys and 499 girls (sex ratio was 1:1.19), 564 boarding students and 355 non-boarding students; and the median age was 17 years old (range was 4\u00b121 years old). The attack rates for middle school students, kindergarten students and teachers were significantly different (p<0.001). Among the 924 cases, 826 (89.39%) suffered from vomiting, 524 (56.71%) from nausea, 298 (32.25%) from abdominal pain, 206 (22.29%) from diarrhoea, 122 (13.20%) from fever and 129 (13.96%) from both vomiting and diarrhoea. No patients were hospitalized. The first case of gastroenteritis occurred on February 12 at 20:00. With the new semester starting on February 16, a rapid increase in the number of cases occurred over the following 3 days. The time distribution showed only one peak incidence on February 18 (Fig 3); no further cases were reported after February 21, 15:00.
