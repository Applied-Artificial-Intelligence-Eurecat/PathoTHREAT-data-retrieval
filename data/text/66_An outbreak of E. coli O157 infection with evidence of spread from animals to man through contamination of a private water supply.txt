An outbreak of E. coli O157 infection occurred in the Highland Region of Scotland in the summer of 1999. The source of the outbreak was traced to an untreated private water supply. All six cases identified arose in visitors to the area, and most had very limited exposure to the contaminated water. Permanent residents on the same supply were unaffected. The E. coli O157 isolates from the water, sheep faeces collected from around the source and the human stool samples were indistinguishable using pulsed field gel electrophoresis. Previously reported outbreaks of E. coli O157 linked to potable water supplies have resulted from structural or treatment failures, which allowed faecal contamination of source water. Here, contamination of the water supply and subsequent human infection was due to the use of an untreated, unprotected private water source in a rural area where animals grazed freely.  All of the cases were linked to a campsite, which was provided with untreated drinking water from a private supply that originated in a `spring' in an area of land grazed by sheep and deer. Surveillance of the water was carried out by Protective Services (Environmental Health) officers from the Highland Council in accordance with current regulations. A sample taken 1 week prior to the first case of illness had failed bacteriological tests (total coliforms of 11 c.f.u./100 ml and E. coli of 15 c.f.u./100 ml), resulting in the issue of a `Boil Water' notice. Further samples taken during the outbreak repeatedly showed levels of indicator organisms above the relevant Significant Medical Risk Values. Analysis of water samples for E. coli O157 was carried out using routine methods at the microbiology laboratory of the local District General Hospital and was negative. Samples sent to the Scottish E. coli O157 Reference Laboratory in Aberdeen for analysis using immunomagnetic separation did, however, show the presence of E. coli O157 in the water samples.
