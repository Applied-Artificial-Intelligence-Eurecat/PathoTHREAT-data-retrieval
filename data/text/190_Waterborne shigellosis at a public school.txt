In November 1972 an outbreak of gastrointestinal illness occurred at a public school in Stockport, Iowa. One hundred ninety-four (72%) of 269 pupils and 14 (61%) of 23 staff members were affected. The etiologic agent was a strain of Shigella sonnei resistant to multiple antimicrobials. Waterborne transmission of shigellosis was documented epidemiologically and by isolation of the organism from the school water system. Ninety-seven (14%) of 698 of the students' household contacts developed diarrhea, and possible secondary cases also occurred in 3 (9%) of 32 household contacts of school staff. During the second week of November 1972 a physician in Fairfield, Iowa, telephoned the Iowa State Department of Health to report a case of S. sonnei infection in a young woman from the town of Stockport in Van Buren County. The patient lived in an apartment across the street from the county middle school, with which she shared a common water supply. Furthermore, several guests at a gathering at her apartment on November 4 had developed gastrointestinal illness, and there were rumors of high rates of absenteeism at the school because of a similar illness.
