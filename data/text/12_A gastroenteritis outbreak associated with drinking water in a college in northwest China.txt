An acute gastroenteritis outbreak occurred at a private college in June 2014 in northwest China. This outbreak involved two teachers and 629 students (range: 17-27 years, average 21.3 years). The main symptoms included non-bloody watery diarrhea, stomach ache, nausea, and vomiting, and the duration of illness ranged from 1 to 7 days. Eight of 18 water samples were disqualified. Thirty-four norovirus (NoV) RNA-positive samples were identified from 48 stool-related samples (genotyping results: 13 GII, 13 GI and 8 GI \u00fe GII mixture). Fourteen NoV samples were successfully characterized for genotype, including two GII.6, five GI.6, four GI.3, and three GI.1. Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) and enteroadherent Escherichia coli (EAEC) DNA was detected from patient stool specimens and water samples from well one; two EAEC strains and one EPEC strain were isolated from patient stool specimens. The risk ratios (RRs) associated with wells one and two were 1.66 and 1.49, respectively, and the RR associated with living in north dormitory building one was 2.59. The patients\u2019 epidemiological characteristics, symptoms, and duration of illness indicated that NoV-contaminated water might be the origin of this outbreak, and RR analysis suggested that the two wells were linked to the outbreak. On June 11, 2014, more than 300 gastroenteritis cases in a private college in Shaanxi Province were detected by Network Monitoring of the Xi\u2019an Center for Disease Control and Prevention (XACDC). An epidemiological survey and control measures were immediately initiated. Cases were defined as college staff members and students with an onset of diarrhea (\u22653 times per day) or vomiting from June 1 to 20, 2014. A retrospective face-to-face questionnaire survey for all patients recorded on the outpatient log in the school hospital was administered through interviews, and the information collected included illness onset, symptoms, duration of illness, and eating and drinking history. All other teachers and students were surveyed by college staff, and students living in south dormitory buildings 4 and 5 were enrolled as controls because these students all learned on the job outside of the campus. An environmental survey was also implemented, including an examination of the local wells, buildings and cafeterias. On June 11, 18 water specimens were collected for laboratory testing. On June 11 and 12, 31 stool samples and 17 rectal swabs were collected from patients. On June 14, the school stopped supplying water from the local wells and began using water transported by truck from the municipal water network. Since July 5, the school began to improve the sanitary conditions of the well, and on July 28, eight water samples were sent to XACDC for sanitary index detection. Bacterial detection in water and stool specimens A total of 18 water samples including seven well water, six tap water, and five direct-drinking water samples were collected and transported to the XACDC for measurement of the hygienic index on the same day. Each water sample (500 mL) was measured for aerobic bacterial count, total coliforms, and thermotolerant coliforms according to the national standards for drinking water quality of China (GB5750-2006). Nucleic acid detection of diarrheogenic Escherichia coli was also performed in 18 water samples and 31 stool samples using commercial real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) kits. Briefly, 20 mL of well water was concentrated by centrifugation at 40,000 \u00d7 g for 5 min; 1 mL of sediment remained, and 200 \u03bcL was employed for nucleic acid extraction. A 0.2 g stool sample was immersed in 1 mL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) and centrifuged at 3,000 \u00d7 g for 5 min; 200 \u03bcL supernatant was used for nucleic acid extraction. Magnetic beads pre-filled from RNA/DNA extraction kits (Lot. T032, Tianlong Science and Technology Co., Xi\u2019an, China) were employed with a nucleic acid extractor according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (NP968-S, Tianlong Science and Technology Co., Xi\u2019an, China). Real-time PCR assays were employed to test for nucleic acids of diarrheogenic E. coli by commercial kits (DD0091-95, Shanghai Liferiver Bio-tech Co., China). E. coli, Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, and Yersinia enterocolitica in 18 water samples and 31 stool samples were also detected through isolation methods. Virus detection in water and fecal samples The nucleotide acid of diarrheal viruses was also investigated in these 18 water samples, 31 stool samples mentioned above and 17 rectal swabs in XACDC. Rectal swabs or 0.2 g stool samples were immersed in 1 mL PBS and vortexed for 30 sec, and they were then clarified by centrifugation at 8,000 \u00d7 g for 5 min at room temperature. A 50 mL sample of water was concentrated by centrifugation at 200,000 \u00d7 g for 30 min, and 1 mL of sediment was used for detection. A total of 200 \u03bcL of supernatant of stool or sediment from water was used to extract viral nucleic acid using magnetic beads pre-filled from RNA/DNA extraction kits (Lot. T001, Tianlong Science and Technology Co., Xi\u2019an, China) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (NP968-S, Tianlong Science and Technology Co., Xi\u2019an, China). Viral RNA was reverse-transcribed (RT) with a First Strand cDNA synthesis kit (Fermentas, EU). The RT step was carried out at 42 \u00b0C for 1 h, followed by heating at 99 \u0003C for 5 min to inactivate the enzyme, and cooling at 4 \u00b0C  immediately. The group A rotaviruses, enteric adenoviruses, NoV GI/GII and astroviruses were simultaneously detected by PCR using the Diarrhea-V ACE Detection system (Seegene, South Korea) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. NoV genotyping by nucleotide sequence analysis The cDNA of GI from the above step were used directly for sequencing PCR using primers SKF/SKR, and region C of OFR2 was amplified using Taq DNA polymerase (Promega) at 95 \u00b0C for 5 min followed by 35 cycles of 94 \u00b0C 30 s, 55 \u00b0C 30 s, 72 \u00b0C 60 s, and a final extension at 72 \u00b0C for 10 min, followed by cooling at 4 \u00b0C (Kojima et al. \uf645\uf643\uf643\uf645). The complete OFR2 was amplified from RNA of GII positive samples with primers GV305/GV308 using SuperScript III One-Step RT-PCR System with Platinum\u2122 Taq High Fidelity DNA Polymerase (Invitrogen) at 50 \u00b0C for 30 min, 94 \u00b0C for 5 min followed by 35 cycles of 94 \u00b0C 30 s, 55 \u00b0C 30 s, 68 \u00b0C 150 s, and a final extension at 68 \u00b0C for 5 min, followed by cooling at 4 \u00b0C (Bull et al.). The PCR products were purified by QIA quick PCR purification kit (Qiagen) and followed by bidirectional sequencing by BigDye 3.1 chemistry with an ABI PRISM 3130 DNA analyzer (Applied Biosystems Inc., CA, USA). Twelve GI and two GII RNA genotypes were amplified and successfully sequenced. The nucleotide sequencing data have been deposited in the GenBank database under accession numbers KX228750-KX228763. Analysis of nucleotide sequence differences and alignment of the sequences were performed using the BioEdit program (www.mbio.ncsu.edu/BioEdit/bioedit.html). Phylogenetic trees were generated with the Mega 6.0 software package using the neighbor-joining method with 1,000 bootstrap replicates (Tamura et al. \uf645\uf643\uf644\uf646). NoV sequences used in the study were retrieved from GenBank (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Genbank). A case distribution curve was generated with Excel, and relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using SPSS Statistics 17.0 software (Chicago, IL, USA). This study was approved by the Ethics Checking Committee of Xi\u2019an CDC (XACDC ECC 01-2014), and written informed consent was obtained from all patients.
