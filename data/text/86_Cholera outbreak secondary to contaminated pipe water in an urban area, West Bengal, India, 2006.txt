Outbreaks of cholera are common in West Bengal. In April 2006, Garulia municipality reported a cluster of diarrhea cases. We investigated this cluster to identify the etiological agent, source of transmission and propose control measures. We defi ned a case of diarrhea as occurrence of >3 loose/watery stools a day among the residents of Garulia since April 2006. We searched for cases of diarrhea in health care facilities and health camp. We conducted a gender- and age-matched case-control study to identify risk factors. We inspected the sanitation and water supply system. We collected rectal swabs from diarrhea patients and water specimens from the affected areas for laboratory investigation. Two hundred and ninety eight cases of diarrhea were reported to various health care facilities (attack rate: 3.5/1000, no deaths). The attack rate was highest among children (6.4/1000). Vibrio cholerae El Tor O1 Inaba was isolated from two of 7 rectal swabs. The outbreak started on 10 April 2006, peaked on 26 April and lasted till 6 May. Cases clustered in an area distal to leaking water pipelines. Drinking municipal water exclusively was significantly associated with the illness (OR 13, 95% CI=6.5-27). Eight of the 12 water specimens from the affected area had fecal contamination and poor chlorine content. This outbreak was due to a contaminated municipal piped water supply and V. cholera 01 Inaba was possibly the causative organism. We identified 298 cases (attack rate: 3.5/1000, no death) of diarrhea. Two of seven rectal swabs grew Vibrio cholerae O1 El Tor, Inaba, while the other five did not grow any pathogen. The initial case-patient, aged 45 years was admitted for severe dehydration on 10 April 2006. Subsequently, cases increased and peaked on 26 April (Fig. 1) and declined. The attack rate was highest among the 0-4 age group (6.4/1000) and both sexes were equally affected. A total of 163 (55%) patients were admitted to the hospital. Among 90 case-patients selected at random, 72 (80%) had vomiting, 27 (30%) abdominal cramps and 32 (36%) severe dehydration. A total of 215 cases (72%) clustered in a specific location. There was no common festival, ceremony or event to be suspected as common source. We recruited all 247 cases (median age 31 years; 140 women) and 247 controls for the matched case-control study (Table 1).
