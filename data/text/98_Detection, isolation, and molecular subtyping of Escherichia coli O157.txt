The largest reported outbreak of waterborne Escherichia coli O157:H7 in the United States occurred in upstate New York following a county fair in August 1999. Culture methods were used to isolate E. coli O157:H7 from specimens from 128 of 775 patients with suspected infections. Campylobacter jejuni was also isolated from stools of 44 persons who developed diarrheal illness after attending this fair. There was one case of a confirmed coinfection with E. coli O157:H7 and C. jejuni. Molecular detection of stx1 and stx2 Shiga toxin genes, immunomagnetic separation (IMS), and selective culture enrichment were utilized to detect and isolate E. coli O157:H7 from an unchlorinated well and its distribution points, a dry well, and a nearby septic tank. PCR for stx1 and stx2 was shown to provide a useful screen for toxin-producing E. coli O157:H7, and IMS subculture improved recovery. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was used to compare patient and environmental E. coli O157:H7 isolates. Among patient isolates, 117 of 128 (91.5%) were type 1 or 1a (three or fewer bands different). Among the water distribution system isolates, 13 of 19 (68%) were type 1 or 1a. Additionally, PFGE of C. jejuni isolates revealed that 29 of 35 (83%) had indistinguishable PFGE patterns. The PFGE results implicated the water distribution system as the main source of the E. coli O157:H7 outbreak. This investigation demonstrates the potential for outbreaks involving more than one pathogen and the importance of analyzing isolates from multiple patients and environmental samples to develop a better understanding of bacterial transmission during an outbreak. Aliquots containing 100, 250, or 500 ml of liquid specimens (water, septic tank contents, or melted ice) were filtered through 0.45-\u00b5m-pore-size filters, and the filters were then placed in 225 ml of E. coli broth supplemented with novobiocin (ECN) (20 \u00b5g/ml). The outbreak was recognized when the Bureau of Communicable Disease Control of the New York State Department of Health became aware of an increased number of persons being evaluated for diarrheal illness at local hospitals. Some hospitalized children showed worsening kidney function, and E. coli O157:H7 was isolated from the stool of one patient. The next day, area hospitals were alerted to consider E. coli O157:H7 infection in patients who presented with diarrheal illness.
