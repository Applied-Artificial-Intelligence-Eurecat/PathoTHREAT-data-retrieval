On 18 September 2013, the Gipuzkoa Epidemiology Unit was notified of an outbreak of acute gastroenteritis (AGE) among employees at a domestic appliance factory. The first signs of the outbreak had emerged at the end of June and at the time of the notification 30 workers were on sick leave for gastroenteritis. Some employees had had more than one episode and the main symptoms were diarrhoea and vomiting. An investigation began to identify the causative agent, assess exposure and determine the route of transmission. Data collected by a questionnaire identified 302 episodes of AGE among 238 people affected between June and September 2013. The source of water consumed was found to be a risk factor associated with the appearance of symptoms both in the crude and the adjusted analysis: odds ratio 1.8 (0.8-4.2) and 6.4 (4.2-9.8), respectively. Microbiological analysis of stool samples and of water confirmed the presence of norovirus and rotavirus. The environmental study detected a connection between an industrial use water system and drinking water at the factory. It was concluded that the outbreak was caused by mixed viral infections, due to contamination of drinking water. Of the 443 individuals who completed the questionnaire, 238 reported gastrointestinal symptoms (53.7%). Among 238 individuals who became ill, there were 302 episodes of AGE. The ages of those affected ranged from 25 to 69 years; with a mean age of 44.6 years and 58.3% were men. The onset of symptoms was on 13 June in the first case and 20 September in the last. Diarrhoea was reported by 94.4%, vomiting 41.7%, nausea 45%, abdominal pain 64.2% and fever 27.5%. A total of 64 cases experienced more than one episode. Less than a third (31%) of them sought medical attention. None was admitted to hospital and all progressed well. After the provisional results of 20 September, the initial measures taken consisted of banning the processing of food and use of drinking water throughout the factory (drinking fountains, cold water dispensers, coffee machines, etc.). A connection was discovered between the drinking water system and industrial water taken from a river (with no disinfection and only minimal treatment). The connection was blocked and the entire drinking water system was cleaned and disinfected by hyperchlorination.
