Here, we report for the first time a waterborne outbreak of Shigella sonnei in China in 2015. Eleven multidrug-resistant (MDR) S. sonnei isolates were recovered, showing high resistance to azithromycin and third-generation cephalosporins in particular, due to an mph(A)- and blaCTX-M-14-harboring IncB/O/K/Z group transmissible plasmid of 104,285 kb in size. Our study highlights the potential prevalence of the MDR outbreak of S. sonnei in China and its further dissemination worldwide with the development of globalization. On 9 September 2015, an outbreak of shigellosis occurred in a kindergarten class in Guangxi Province, China. We launched an epidemiological field investigation. This study was approved by the ethics committee of the Institute of Disease Control and Prevention, Academy of Military Medical Sciences. Cases were defined as students with two or more of the following symptoms of acute gastroenteritis between 30 August and 28 September 2015: diarrhea (more than 3 times per day), stool abnormalities (watery, mucus, bloody purulent, or bloody stools), nausea and/or vomiting, abdominal pain, and fever (>38\u00b0C). The first case was traced to a 5-year-old boy who presented with symptoms, including severe diarrhea (more than 10 watery stools/day), fever, tenesmus, and vomiting on 6 September. From 6 to 11 September, a total of 38 cases were identified among 285 children in the kindergarten class (attack rate, 13.33%). On 9 September, the incidence rate reached a peak (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). The male/female ratio was 1.53:1, and the median age was 4 years (range, 2 to 6 years) (see Table S1). Cases were observed from all eight kindergarten classes (see Fig. S2). All patients recovered, and no deaths were observed. Based on an environmental epidemiological investigation, we found that the canteen and water supply systems were in poor sanitary condition. After disinfection and other control measures, no new cases occurred. During the outbreak, we collected 35 fresh samples for laboratory identification of enteric pathogens, including 19 rectal swabs and 2 vomitus samples from 19 children with diarrhea, six drinking water samples, and eight suspicious residual foods from the kindergarten. All food and water samples were collected by sterile sampling according to the national food safety standards, such as GB 4789.1-2016, GB 4789.2-2016, GB 4789.3-2016, GB 4789.4-2016, GB 4789.6-2016, and GB 4789.10-2016, and standards for drinking water quality, GB 5749-2006. Suspected isolates recovered from the samples were identified using a commercial biochemical test kit (API 20E system; bioM\u00e9rieux Vitek, France) according to the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations. The serotype of Shigella isolates was then determined using a serotyping kit (Denka Seiken, Tokyo, Japan) according to standard methods. We isolated 11 S. sonnei strains from the 35 samples, including nine in rectal swabs and two in drinking water. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by broth microdilution in 96-well microtiter plates (Sensititre, Trek Diagnostic Systems; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., West Sussex, UK) according to the methods of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (5).
