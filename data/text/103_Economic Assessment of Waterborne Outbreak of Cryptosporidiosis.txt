In 2007, a waterborne outbreak of Cryptosporidium hominis infection occurred in western Ireland, resulting in 242 laboratory-confirmed cases and an uncertain number of unconfirmed cases. A boil water notice was in place for 158 days that affected 120,432 persons residing in the area, businesses, visitors, and commuters. This outbreak represented the largest outbreak of cryptosporidiosis in Ireland. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the cost of this outbreak. We adopted a societal perspective in estimating costs associated with the outbreak. Economic cost estimated was based on totaling direct and indirect costs incurred by public and private agencies. The cost of the outbreak was estimated based on 2007 figures. We estimate that the cost of the outbreak was >\u20ac19 million (\u2248\u20ac120,000/day of the outbreak). The US dollar equivalent based on today\u2019s exchange rates would be $22.44 million (\u2248$142,000/day of the outbreak). This study highlights the economic need for a safe drinking water supply. Outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis are common in Ireland. During 2011-2014, a total of 100 outbreaks (84 of which were outbreaks in families) were reported that included 305 cases (5). In March 2007, the largest outbreak of cryptosporidiosis in Ireland since surveillance began was identified and was associated with contamination of the public water supply serving an urban area (Galway, Ireland) and surrounding areas. The outbreak was distinguished from the usual spring peak not only by the number of cases but also by the predominantly urban distribution and the infecting species (C. hominis). The outbreak lasted for 5 months, by which time there were 242 confirmed cases of cryptosporidiosis (Health Service Executive [HSE], Galway, Ireland, unpub. data), although it was likely that the actual number affected was higher (14). A boil water notice was put in place for the duration of the outbreak (158 days); the order affected \u2248120,432 persons. The outbreak ended in August 2007 after major investments by local authorities in water treatment infrastructure and major disruption to residents and local businesses.
