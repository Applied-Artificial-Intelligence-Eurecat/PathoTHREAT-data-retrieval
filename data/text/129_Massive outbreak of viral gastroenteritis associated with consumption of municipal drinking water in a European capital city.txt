On 24 August 2008, an outbreak alert regarding cases of acute gastroenteritis in Podgorica triggered investigations to guide control measures. From 23 August to 7 September, 1699 cases were reported in Podgorica (population 136 000) and we estimated the total size of the outbreak to be 10 000-15 000 corresponding to an attack rate of y10%. We conducted an age- and neighbourhood-matched case-control study, microbiologically analysed faecal and municipal water samples and assessed the water distribution system. All cases (83/83) and 90% (89/90) of controls drank unboiled chlorinated municipal water [matched odds ratio (mOR) 11.2, 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.6-O]. Consumption of bottled water was inversely associated with illness (mOR 0.3, 95% CI 0.1-0.8). Analyses of faecal samples identified six norovirus genotypes (21/38 samples) and occasionally other viruses. Multiple defects in the water distribution system were noted. These results suggest that the outbreak was caused by faecally contaminated municipal water. It is unusual to have such a large outbreak in a European city especially when the municipal water supply is chlorinated. Therefore, it is important to establish effective multiple-barrier water-treatment systems whenever possible, but even with an established chlorinated supply, sustained vigilance is central to public health. On 24 August 2008, the Institute of Public Health (IPH) of Montenegro was informed of an unusually high number of patients presenting with acute gastroenteritis, at both the Infectious Disease and Paediatric hospitals in the city of Podgorica. The IPH promptly initiated an outbreak investigation and informed the World Health Organisation (WHO) Country Office. Physicians in Montenegro are required to report infectious diseases and syndromes both to the regional public health office and to IPH in Podgorica. Acute gastroenteritis is subject to mandatory notification by health centres/doctors and is broadly defined as \u2018anyone presenting to their health centre/doctor with the following symptoms: abdominal pain, vomiting and/or nausea, diarrhoea and/or fever\u2019.
