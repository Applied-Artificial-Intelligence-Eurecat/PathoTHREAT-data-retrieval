Cyanotoxins have long been recognized as potential sources of contamination for drinking water supplies. As far back as 1930, there have been suspected links between algal blooms in municipal water supply source waters and gastroenteritis outbreaks (Dillenberg & Dehnel 1960). However, cyanotoxins are not yet regulated in the United States under the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA). Although cyanobacteria and their toxins have been identified as microbial contaminant candidates on the four Contaminant Candidate Lists (CCLs) that the US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) has issued under the SDWA to date, cyanotoxins have not yet been included in any of the past three Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Rules (UCMRs), primarily due to the lack of a robust and reliable analytical method at the time. In August 2014, the City of Toledo, Ohio, issued a do not drink/do not boil (DND/DNB) notice to all customers served by the city\u2019s water system because of a detection of microcystin in the drinking water that exceeded the lifetime chronic exposure threshold concentration of 1 \u03bcg/L established by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency at that time. This weekend-long DND/DNB notice affected nearly 500,000 residents and businesses served by the City of Toledo and was the largest DND/DNB order caused by cyanotoxin contamination in US history.
