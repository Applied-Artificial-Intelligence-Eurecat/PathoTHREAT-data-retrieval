In an epidemic of Shigella sonnei gastroenteritis, probably waterborne, 1216 people were affected within three weeks, 302 of them members of communal settlements, the kibbutzim. A descriptive study of the epidemic in six affected kibbutzim in the area showed that the highest rates of diarrhoea occurred in a kibbutz that received its drinking water solely from the allegedly contaminated well. People at high risk within the kibbutzim were temporary visitors from Europe and the US (the volunteers), children aged 1 to 5 years, adult women, and children and their mothers in kibbutzim where the sleeping arrangements for the children was in 'children's houses'. In March 1989, a diarrhoea epidemic occurred in Western Galilee, affecting many communities including the kibbutzim (collective agricultural communities) in the area. Results of the preliminary investigation by the Ministry of Health,8 indicated that a total of 1216 cases of diarrhoea were diagnosed. The shape of the epidemic curve suggested a common source epidemic as the main route of transmission, probably drinking water. The settlements involved were spread along the geographical distribution of the water supply in an area where there had been previous episodes of drinking water contamination. Of the diarrhoea cases who had stools sent for culture, 74% grew S. sonnei in pure culture. Thus, although Shigella was not isolated from the water at any time, careful elimination of other possible vehicles of transmission suggested strong circumstantial evidence for contamination of the drinking water, most probably from the Gaaton spring.
