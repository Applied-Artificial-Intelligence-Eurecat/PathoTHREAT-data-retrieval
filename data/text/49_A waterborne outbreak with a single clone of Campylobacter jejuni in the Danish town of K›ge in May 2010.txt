Background: In Denmark, large-scale waterborne outbreaks are rare. This report describes the investigation of an outbreak that occurred in the town of K\u00f8ge in May 2010. Methods: The epidemiological investigation consisted of hypothesis generating telephone interviews, followed by a cohort study among approximately 20,000 residents using an online questionnaire. Odds ratios were calculated for exposures including the number of glasses of tap water consumed. Geographical spreading was assessed using a geographical information system. The microbiological investigation included cultures of stool samples and flagellin-typing. In the environmental investigation, water samples were tested for Escherichia coli and coliform counts and for DNA of Campylobacter, Enterococcus, and Bacteroides. During the outbreak investigation a water boiling order was enforced, as tap water was considered a potential source. Results: Of 45 patients with laboratory confirmed Campylobacter infection in the municipality of K\u00f8ge in May, 43 lived in the area covered by the central water supply. Of 61 patients with laboratory confirmed Campylobacter jejuni by 8 June, 50 shared a common flagellin gene type - flaA type 36 (82%). The epidemic curve from the cohort study showed a wave of diarrhoea onset from 14 to 20 May ( n = 176). Among these patients, the development of diarrhoea was associated with drinking tap water with a dose - response pattern (linear increase by 2 glasses: odds ratio 1.40, 95% confidence interval 1.16 - 1.70). No bacterial DNA was found in water samples. Conclusions: These findings indicated a point source contamination of tap water with a single clone of C. jejuni which likely occurred on 12 - 13 May. The water boiling order was lifted on 18 June. The current outbreak was detected following the notification of 6 cases of Campylobacter infection to the Public Health Medical Office of Zealand on 28 May 2010 by a general practitioner in K\u00f8ge, Denmark; all 6 patients had disease onset between 16 and 18 May 2010 and lived within a distance of 3 km of each other. Telephone interviews with other general practitioners in K\u00f8ge showed that they had also seen more patients with gastroenteritis than usual. These interviews brought 4 additional patients with confirmed Campylobacter infection to our attention. The laboratory surveillance system for the region, which includes the city of K\u00f8ge, confirmed an increase in the incidence of Campylobacter; 25 stool samples with confirmed Campylobacter infection were received on 20 and 21 May 2010, compared to an average of 2 on the earlier days in May 2010. An outbreak investigation was initiated on 30 May 2010. This report describes the outbreak investigation and the policy-making process based on the available evidence.
