Monophasic variant of Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar Typhimurium (monophasic S. Typhimurium), with antigenic structure 1,4,[5],12:i:-, appears to be of increasing importance in Europe. 
In Italy, monophasic S. Typhimurium represented the third most frequent Salmonella serovar isolated from human cases between 2004 and 2008. From June 2013 to October 2014, a total of 206 human cases of salmonellosis were identified in Abruzzo region (Central Italy). Obtained clinical isolates characterised showed S. Typhimurium 1,4,[5],12:i:- with sole resistance to nalidixic acid, which had never been observed in Italy in monophasic S. Typhimurium, neither in humans nor in animals or foods. Epidemiological, microbiological and environmental investigations were conducted to try to identify the outbreak source. Cases were interviewed using a standardised questionnaire and microbiological tests were performed on human as well as environmental samples, including samples from fruit and vegetables, pigs, and surface water. Investigation results did not identify the final vehicle of human infection, although a link between the human cases and the contamination of irrigation water channels was suggested. A total of 206 cases (98 confirmed, 101 probable, 7 possible) were identified in Italy 
between June 2013 and September 2014 (Figure 1). No cases possibly linked to this outbreak were reported from the 14 countries (including the US) reacting to the EPIS alert. Data on clinical signs were complete for 90 patients and the mean duration of illness was seven days (range: 1-30 days). Diarrhoea was the most important symptom (89/90; 99%), followed by abdominal pain (57/85; 67%), weakness (22/39; 56%), bloody diarrhoea (19/46; 41%), vomiting (32/86; 37%), fever defined as >37.5\u00b0C (28/92; 30%), nausea (13/77; 17%), and diffuse pain (4/35; 11%). Among symptomatic cases, 46 (51%) were hospitalised. The median age of hospitalised patients was 
four years (range: 1-91 years). No significant correlation was observed between the age of cases and the duration of the illness (Kendall's coefficient = 0.03) or its severity (Kendall's coefficient = 0.05). A man aged > 70 years died following the S. Typhimurium infection. The positive sample of irrigation water was taken from irrigation pipelines with water from the Vera river, which is tributary of the Aterno river, and from which surface water samples also tested positive. The samples of fruit and/or vegetables taken from the fields irrigated with the contaminated water were negative for Salmonella. Monophasic S. Typhimurium outbreak strain was detected in five sewage treatment plants localised on the Aterno river and in one sewage treatment plant localised on the Raio stream flowing into Aterno river (Figure 2). The geographical location of 21 water samples testing positive for monophasic S. Typhimurium with the same characteristics as the outbreak strain is shown in Figure 2. In October 2013 a significant increase of human cases of salmonellosis in L'Aquila province (Abruzzo region, Central Italy) was reported to EnterNet Italia. In the period between June and October 2013 only, ca 30 salmonellosis cases, corresponding to 9.9 cases per 100,000 population [13], were observed in the L'Aquila province, clearly excessing levels of previous recent years. This included sampling of all commercial pig herds of L'Aquila province (faecal, dust, drinking water and feed samples were taken in each herd), and the examination of ileocaecal lymph nodes taken from swine at slaughterhouses to assess the status of Salmonella infection in pigs bred and slaughtered in the province. In addition, locally produced fruit and vegetables, mainly fresh vegetables grown in open fields and intended to be consumed raw, were directly collected in a subset of producing farms.  Information on patient's age was collected for 192 cases and the median value was 4 years (range: 0-91 years). The age of cases significantly differed (Fisher's test p < 0.01) from that of the Abruzzo population, taken as \u2018control' population, and the greatest number of cases (n = 98; 51%) occurred in patients 
aged between one and four years (Pearson's chi-squared: 1,248; p < 0.01). No significant difference was observed by sex (53% males and 47% females). Data on clinical signs were complete for 90 patients and the mean duration of illness was seven days (range: 1-30 days). Diarrhoea was the most important symptom (89/90; 99%), followed by abdominal pain (57/85; 67%), weakness (22/39; 56%), bloody diarrhoea (19/46; 41%), vomiting (32/86; 37%), fever defined as >37.5\u00b0C (28/92; 30%), nausea (13/77; 17%), and diffuse pain (4/35; 11%). Among symptomatic cases, 46 (51%) were hospitalised. The median age of hospitalised patients was four years (range: 1-91 years).
