Noroviruses are a common cause of acute gastroenteritis around the world; however, reports of outbreaks caused by GII.17 norovirus are rare. An outbreak caused by GII.17 norovirus in a senior high school in Wuxi, Jiangsu Province, China is reported here. An epidemiological investigation, pathogen detection, and case-control study were performed. Epidemiological data combined with the epidemic curve indicated that this outbreak was a point source type initially, followed by secondary transmission. The first case was identified as most likely the source of the outbreak. Risk analysis showed exposure to patients and sharing a communal water cooler to be associated with the spread of infection. Sequence analysis of GII-positive samples confirmed that the norovirus GII.17 variant was the etiological agent of this outbreak. On December 11, 2014, it was reported that 57 students at a senior high school in the city of Wuxi, China had developed acute diarrhea and vomiting. Rectal swab samples from nine of the patients were found to be positive for norovirus GII.17 using reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR). In order to provide effective control measures, the outbreak was surveyed to verify additional cases and the source of infection, the vehicle for infection, and the mode of transmission. In accordance with the Surveillance Program for the Viral Diarrhea Outbreak of Jiangsu Province, a total of 30 rectal swabs were collected, 10 from the case group, 10 from cafeteria food handlers, and 10 from the non-case group. As this was a highly transmissible environmental contagious agent, surface swabs were also collected from kitchen rags, kitchen cabinets, cafeteria tables, and the communal water cooler dispensers in the affected classrooms. A 10-l water sample was also collected from the communal water coolers in every affected classroom. On December 14, 2014, the earliest suspected norovirus case, an extern student in grade three, vomited several times in public areas including the classroom and the washroom. Over the next 3 days, 27 further cases occurred, which were mainly located on the fourth floor (12 cases) and third floor (nine cases). Thus, the epidemic reached its first incidence peak (Figure 1). A decrease in cases followed after the implementation of control measures such as quarantine and disinfection. However, several days later, the attack rate peaked again on December 25. In contrast to the first peak, this time the student cases were mainly distributed on the second floor (12 cases) and third floor (five cases). To control further spread of the disease, the school was closed temporarily. As a result, the outbreak came to an end on the last day of 2014 (Figure 1). According to the epidemiological questionnaire results, a total 57 of 2209 people were recorded as cases up to December 31, 2014, giving an attack rate of 2.58%. The cases were all students ranging in age from 16 to 19 years. The main symptoms were diarrhea (80.7%), vomiting (64.9%), abdominal cramps (47.4%), and fever (7.0%). The 57 student cases were distributed across 3 grades and 21 classes. The attack rate of students in grade 3 (5.0%, 35/700) was significantly higher than those in grade 2 (2.0%, 13/650) and grade 1 (1.46%, 9/616) (p < 0.05). During the outbreak, nine of 30 rectal swab samples tested positive for norovirus GII. Surface swabs and water samples from the water coolers tested negative for norovirus in the outbreaks. The GII-positive samples were further genotyped by semi-nested PCR and sequencing.11,12 Phylogenetic analysis showed that the strains isolated in this outbreak were grouped with the GII.17 strains isolated from Guangdong Province (KP718639, 2014), Taiwan (KJ156329, 2013), and Japan (AB983218, 2014).
