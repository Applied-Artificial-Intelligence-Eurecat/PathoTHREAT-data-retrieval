A gastroenteritis outbreak was observed in the town of Xanthi on Jan 28, 2005. A total of 709 patients (350 males and 359 females, mean age 23.8 19.95 years) visited the local hospital over a period of two weeks with symptoms of fever (22.3%), abdominal pain (78.6%), nausea (85.5%), vomiting (67.1%) and diarrhea (72.5%). PCR for Norovirus in randomly selected stool specimens examined was positive in all cases (8/8). No other pathogen was revealed. As 85.1 % of the primary affected individuals had been using water from a single well (supplying approximately 40% of the 34,889 inhabitants), and water specimens from this well were found to carry a high bacterial load, the waterborne transmission  of Norovirus was the main suspected cause of the outbreak. People were advised to consume bottled water and to wash their hands carefully especially after toilet use until the remission of the outbreak. Additionally, more chloride was added to the suspected well (10 ppm or 10 mg/l). Fourteen days later, the outbreak waned and all measures were withdrawn. Methods Seven hundred and nine consecutive patients who visited the Emergency Department of the General Xanthi hospital with symptoms of acute gastroenteritis between January 28, 2005 and February 10, 2005 were enrolled in the study. A detailed medical record including gender, age, time of onset of the disease as well as the presence of fever, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea and consumption of suspicious food was collected from each patient. The address of each patient was located on a town map as a red dot. Two districts were discriminated according to the water supply; one corresponding to the Paradisos source, representing 60% of the citizens (or 20,933 people as the population of Xanthi counted 34,889 citizens in the last consensus) and the other to the Drosero well, representing the remainder. Water specimens were collected from the points where the majority of the gastroenteritis cases had been referred for chemical and bacteriological analysis. Free chloride was measured and bacteriological cultures were examined after incubation in proper conditions before (Jan 30, 2005) and after (Feb 2, 2005) the application of high-level chlorination (10 ppm or 10 mg/L for several hours). Stool specimens, during the acute phase of illness, were also collected from the first 8 patients and were examined for Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, Yersinia, Enterotoxic E. coli, Enterohaemorrhagic E. coli as well as for the presence of enteropathogenic viruses. Chi-square test was used to compare discrete parameters. The level of statistical significance was set at p<0.05. Results From the total of 709 cases, 359 (50.63%) were female and 350 (49.37%) were male patients. The mean age of affected individuals was 23.57 19.95 years, and 262 cases (36.95%) were pediatric cases (Fig. 1). From all affected individuals, 158 (22.3%) presented fever, 557 (78.6%) abdominal pain, (85.5%) nausea, 476 (67.1%) vomiting and 514 (72.5%) diarrhea. No fatal cases were reported. Eighteen cases (2.54%) were hospitalized. An 83 year-old man developed acute renal failure, which was successfully treated. PCR for Norovirus in stool specimens examined was positive in all cases (8/8). No other viral or bacterial pathogen was revealed. The bacteriological cultures of water specimens from Drosero well revealed a huge load of E. coli, Enterococcus, Clostridium and Psudomonas spp. In contrast, the water specimens from Paradisos source did not contain bacterial pathogens. Unfortunately, virological examination of these specimens was technically not possible (20).  Fig.2 depicts the course ofthe number of gastroenteritis patients who visited the Emergency Department of Xanthi General hospital. During the first 96 hours, the spatial distribution of the gastroenteritis cases in the town map indicated that 85.1% (337/396) ofthem derived from the district which received water from Drosero well (Fig.3). Using Chi-square (goodness of fit) a strong relation of the gastroenteritis cases with the Drosero well was documented (p<0.0001 ). As the waterborne transmission of the outbreak was prominent, the Regional Public Ilealth Bureau announced that water use was forbidden (Jan 29, 2005) and recommended frequent handwashing and the use of masks and gloves before approaching potentially soiled surfaces. Moreover, high-level chlorination ( 10 ppm or 10 mg/L for several hours) was applied to Drosero well as a measure of adequate disinfection (Jan 30, 2005) (20).
