During March 2011 an outbreak of gastroenteritis occurred in Santo Stefano di Quisquina, Agrigento, Sicily, Italy. Within two weeks 156 cases were identified among the 4,965 people living in the municipality. An epidemiological investigation was conducted to characterize the outbreak and target the control measures. A case was defined as a person developing diarrhea or vomiting during February 27-March 13, 2011. Stool specimens were collected from 12 cases. Norovirus (NoV) genotype GII.4 variant New Orleans 2009 was identified in stool samples from 11 of 12 cases tested (91.7%). Epidemiological investigations suggested a possible association with municipal drinking water consumption. Water samples from the public water system were tested for NoV and a variety of genotypes were detected during the first 3 months of surveillance, including GII.4 strains belonging to different variants from that involved in the gastroenteritis outbreak. Contamination of the well and springs supplying the public water network was eventually thought to be the source of the NoV contamination. On March 4, 2011, the Public Health Agency of Agrigento, Sicily, Italy, was alerted about an unexpectedly high number of individuals who had fallen sick with gastrointestinal symptoms during the previous days in Santo Stefano di Quisquina, a small municipality with an area of 85.94 km2 and a population of 4,965 people located in the southwestern part of Sicily. Chlorine concentration of the water supply was also increased from the original 0.2 mg/L, corresponding to the concentration currently recommended for waters intended for human consumption in Italy, to 0.4 mg/L, assuming this level could be recommended as safe during the outbreak. This increased level of chlorine was maintained through the whole surveillance period. In total, 156 inhabitants of Santo Stefano di Quisquina were defined as probable cases of the AGE outbreak described in this investigation according to the criteria for outbreak case definition. Figure 1 shows the epidemic curve with probable cases by date of onset of symptoms. The attack rate for the inhabitants was 3.14% (156/4,965). Age group-specific attack rates (Figure 2) ranged from 2.26% in the age group 25-44 years (28/1,238) to 4.78% (23/481) for the 5-14-year-old group. There was no fatality. Based on the available medical records, symptoms included vomiting (>1 episode/day; 78.4%), diarrhea (>3 stools/day; 73.9%), abdominal pain (75.9%), fever (T> 38 WC; 38.7%), and headache (15.7%). The prospect that the water supply could be involved in the outbreak induced the authorities to increase chlorine concentration of the municipal drinking water and to advise the population to drink bottled water or boil the municipal water before use.
