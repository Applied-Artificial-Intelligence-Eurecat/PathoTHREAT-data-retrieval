We investigated a large gastroenteritis outbreak that occurred in Northern Greece in 2019. A case was defined as anyone presenting with diarrhoea and/or vomiting from 24 January 2019 to 04 February 2019.We conducted a case-control study (CCS) using random selection of participants >16 years of age, residents of town X, who visited the health care centre between 25 and 28 January 2019. Moreover, we conducted a retrospective cohort study (CS) at the four elementary schools of the town. We collected clinical and water samples and the water supply system was inspected. In total, we recorded 638 cases (53% female; median age was 44 years (range 0-93)). Forty-eight cases and 52 controls participated in the CCS and 236 students in the CS. Both CCS and CS indicated tap water as the most likely source (OR 10, 95% CI 2.09-93.4, explaining 95.7% of cases; RR = 2.22, 95% CI 1.42-3.46, respectively). More than one pathogen was detected from stool samples of 6 of the 11 cases tested (norovirus, Campylobacter jejuni, Enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) and Enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC)). Water samples, collected after ad-hoc chlorination, tested negative. Technical failures of the water tanks\u2019 status were identified. Our results suggested a waterborne outbreak. We recommended regular monitoring of the water supply system and immediate repair of technical failures. On 26 January 2019, health care services in Northern Greece informed the National Public Health Organization (EODY) on the occurrence of a high number of gastroenteritis cases. The event attracted wide media and public attention. We collected stool samples from patients with gastroenteritis symptoms that visited the health care services and sent to the Regional Public Health Laboratory (PEDY) of Thessaly. Samples were tested for bacteria (Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., Campylobacter spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, Escherichia coli O157) by standard culture methods. More than one pathogen was detected in six of the 11 stool samples tested (Table 5); four were positive for two and two were positive for three pathogens each. Campylobacter spp. was the most commonly identified pathogen (found in eight clinical samples), followed by norovirus (found in five). Campylobacter spp. Was detected together with various pathogens, mostly with diarrheagenic E.coli. Two norovirus strains were sequenced and belonged to the GII.Pe-GII.4_Sydney_2012 genotype (GenBank accession No MN923214-MN923215). Six water samples were collected on 26 January 2019 by the public health inspectors after ad-hoc chlorination. The five samples collected from the water supply network were negative for all the indicators while the sample from the spring was positive for E. coli (<4 cfu/100 ml) and total coliforms (15 cfu/100 ml). Molecular testing of spring water for norovirus was negative.
