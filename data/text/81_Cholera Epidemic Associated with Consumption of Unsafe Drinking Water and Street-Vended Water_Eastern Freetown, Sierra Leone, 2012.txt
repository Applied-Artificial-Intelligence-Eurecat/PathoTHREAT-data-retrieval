During 2012, Sierra Leone experienced a cholera epidemic with 22,815 reported cases and 296 deaths. We conducted a matched case-control study to assess risk factors, enrolling 49 cases and 98 controls. Stool specimens were analyzed by culture, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Conditional logistic regression found that consuming unsafe water (matched odds ratio [mOR]: 3.4; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.1, 11.0), street-vended water (mOR: 9.4; 95% CI: 2.0, 43.7), and crab (mOR: 3.3; 95% CI: 1.03, 10.6) were significant risk factors for cholera infection. Of 30 stool specimens, 13 (43%) showed PCR evidence of toxigenic Vibrio cholerae O1. Six specimens yielded isolates of V. cholerae O1, El Tor; PFGE identified a pattern previously observed in seven countries. We recommended ensuring the quality of improved water sources, promoting household chlorination, and educating street vendors on water handling practices. Sierra Leone, located on the West African coast, reported four cholera outbreaks from 2000 to 2010. In 2012, the country experienced its largest cholera outbreak since 1995. From January 1 to December 9, 22,815 cholera cases and 296 deaths (case fatality ratio, 1.3%) were reported to the Ministry of Health and Sanitation (MOHS) (Figure 1). Cholera was first identified during early 2012 and the outbreak appeared to be resolving by April 1 (Week 13). The number of reported weekly cases began to accelerate on July 15 (Week 28) and peaked between August 12 and 26 (Weeks 32-34). This phase of the outbreak coincided with the start of the rainy season in late June and the first confirmed case of cholera in Western Area, the seat of the capital Freetown and the most densely populated region in Sierra Leone (Figure 2). From 1990 through 2009, annual rainfall in June has been reported at 30 cm with a peak of 53 cm in August.8 Cases were defined as the first person \u2265 5 years of age with acute watery diarrhea and severe dehydration in a household, who was hospitalized for at least 1 night and treated with intravenous fluids between September 10 and 21, 2012. We enrolled 49 cases and 98 age- and neighborhood-matched controls. The median age was 23 years (5-50) for cases and 25 years (6-77) for controls. Cases and controls were similar in gender and household size. Although Sierra Leone\u2019s country-wide attack rate was 0.41%, Western area, the most populous urban district that includes Freetown, experienced an attack rate of 0.95% (Sierra Leone Cholera Command and Control Center, unpublished data).
