During two epidemics of acute diarrhoea in China in late 1982/early 1983, more than 12 000 adults in two coal mining districts were affected. The virus isolated from stool samples resembled a rotavirus morphologically. Antigenically it lacked the group antigen shared by known rotaviruses. Like other rotaviruses it had a double-stranded RNA with 11 discrete segments, but the pattern of migration of the segments on polyacrylamide electrophoresis differed from those of other rotaviruses. There are 8 residential districts around Jinzhou. The incidence was 31 . 39% in district A, 27 . 39% in district B, 22 - 39% in district C, and 5.44% in the other residential districts, where sporadic cases were seen. The water supply for districts A, B, and C was later found to be faecally contaminated, the bacterial count being 300/ml, and more than 230/ml for Escherichia coli. Among inhabitants in the same districts who used deep well water instead the incidence was much lower (11 - 59%). The incidence in districts A, B, and C rose abruptly to reach a peak lasting from December 20 to January 4, whereas in the other residential districts the rise was more gradual and the peak later, lasting from January 5 to 14 (fig 1). The pattern of spread suggests that the disease was spread initially by the water supply and later by close personal contact. No evidence of respiratory spread was found. Our belief that spread occurred by the faecal-oral route was substantiated by the facts that the incidence of disease was much higher among those whose water supply was polluted and that the epidemic quickly subsided after control of water and food hygiene. The incidence was 22\u201974% for males and 19.71% for females in Jinzhou, but 15-8% and 8 &deg; 7070, respectively, for Lanzhou; these sex differences were not significant. All age groups were affected, most commonly those aged 10-40 (table). The average incubation period was 56\u2019 5 h and the illness was cholera-like with sudden onset and severe diarrhoea. Signs and symptoms occurred in varying combinations and degrees of severity. The prevalence of watery diarrhoea was 100%, vomiting 80%, abdominal cramps 63%, nausea 56%, dehydration 49%, leucopenia 30%, leucocytosis 18%, and low-grade fever 1%. There were no deaths and all patients recovered completely whether antibiotics were given or not. Symptoms usually lasted 1-14 days (average 6 days). 86 faecal samples were tested for bacterial pathogens, and only 3 were positive for Shigella flexner. We tested for Shigella, Salmonella spp, and Vibrio cholerae but not for enteropathogenic Esch coli.
