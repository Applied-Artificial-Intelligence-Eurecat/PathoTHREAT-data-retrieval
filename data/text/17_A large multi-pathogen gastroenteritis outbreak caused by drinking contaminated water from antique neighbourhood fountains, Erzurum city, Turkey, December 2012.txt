We investigated a gastroenteritis outbreak in Erzurum city, Turkey in December 2012 to identify its cause and mode of transmission. We defined a probable case as onset of diarrhoea (\u22653 episodes/day) or vomiting, plus fever or nausea or abdominal pain during 19\u201327 December, 2012 in an Erzurum city resident. In a case-control study we compared exposures of 95 randomly selected probable cases and 95 neighbourhood-matched controls. We conducted bacterial culture and real-time multiplex PCR for identification of pathogens. During the week before illness onset, 72% of cases and 15% of controls only drank water from antique neighbourhood fountains; conversely, 16% of cases and 65% of controls only drank bottled or tap water (adjusted odds ratio 20, 95% confidence interval 4\u00b76\u201384, after controlling for age and sex using conditional logistic regression). Of eight stool specimens collected, two were positive for Shigella sonnei, one for astrovirus, one for astrovirus and norovirus, and one for astrovirus and rotavirus. Water samples from the fountains had elevated total coliform (38-300/100 ml) and Escherichia coli (22-198/100 ml) counts. In conclusion, drinking contaminated fountain water caused this multi-pathogen outbreak. Residents should stop drinking water from these fountains, and clean water from the water treatment plant should be connected to the fountains. We defined a suspected case as a diagnosis of gastroenteritis in a Yakutiye District resident during a visit between 19 and 27 December 2012 to the three public hospitals and one private hospital serving residents of the three central city districts, based on the following International Classification of Diseases-10 (ICD-10) codes: A09 (Infectious gastroenteritis), R11 (Nausea or vomiting), and K52 (Non-infectious gastroenteritis). A probable case was onset during 19\u201327 December 2012 in a Yakutiye District resident of vomiting or diarrhoea, plus at least one of the following clinical presentations: fever, nausea, or abdominal pain. We identified the cases by reviewing medical records at the four hospitals.
