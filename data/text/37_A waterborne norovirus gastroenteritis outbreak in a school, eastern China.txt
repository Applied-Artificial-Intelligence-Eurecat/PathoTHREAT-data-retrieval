In late 2014, a gastroenteritis outbreak occurred in a school in Shandong Province, eastern China. Hundreds of individuals developed the symptoms of diarrhoea and vomiting. Epidemiological investigation showed that food consumption was not linked to this outbreak, and unboiled direct drinking water was identified as the independent risk factor with a relative risk of 1.37 (95% confidence interval 1.03\u20131.83). Furthermore, examination of common bacterial and viral gastroenteritis pathogens was conducted on different specimens. Norovirus GI.1, GI.2, GI.6, GII.4, GII.6 and GII.13 were detected in clinical specimens and a water sample. GII.4 sequences between clinical specimens and the water sample displayed a close relationship and belonged to GII.4 variant Sydney 2012. These results indicate that direct drinking water contaminated by norovirus was responsible for this gastroenteritis outbreak. This study enriches our knowledge of waterborne norovirus outbreaks in China, and presents valuable prevention and control practices for policy-makers. In future, strengthened surveillance and supervision of direct drinking-water systems is needed. On 25 November 2014, Shandong Center for Disease Control and Prevention (SDCDC) was informed that a gastroenteritis outbreak had occurred in a school in Binzhou. Hundreds of students developed diarrhoea and vomiting. Immediately, a control team including epidemiologists and microbial experts was formed to investigate this event. As a matter of course, the food supply was changed first on 25 November, and the drinking water supply was subsequently cut-off on 26 November. After these control measures, the number of patients decreased markedly (from 334 to 43 in 2 days). However, on 14 December, the school restored the drinking water supply. Days later, the gastroenteritis outbreak recurred. On 28 December the school again cut-off the drinking water supply and this outbreak eventually came to an end on 5 January 2015. A retrospective cohort study was performed to identify possible foodborne or waterborne risk factors on 26 November. The exposure was defined as consuming suspected foods or unboiled direct drinking water. A student with diarrhoea and/or vomiting (53 times/day) was defined as a case. Non-cases were defined as students without symptoms of diarrhoea or vomiting at the longest incubation period of norovirus infection (48 h) after exposure to suspected risk factors. SPSS v. 20.0 (SPSS Inc., USA) was used to calculate the attack rate (AR), relative risk (RR), and 95% confidence interval (CI). In order to recognize the possible contamination, an environmental survey on water source was conducted. Teachers were found to have been supplied with barrelled water, which was purchased and supplied by the school. Students were served direct drinking water. The construction log of water network and leaks in the water pipes, water heaters and surrounding facilities were also investigated. The network supplying direct drinking water was found to be buried at a depth of 0.7 m and had been used for 2 years. Moreover, several septic tanks were close to the network (only 1 m away), and the distance between direct drinking-water supply network and sewage pipes was <2 m. At the peaks of two outbreak waves (25, 26 November and 21, 22 December), a total of 33 clinical specimens (including six vomitus and 27 stool specimens) were collected from confirmed cases by health professionals. At that time, every food item was aseptically collected from canteens daily and 46 food samples were collected eventually. At the second outbreak wave (22 December), five direct drinking-water samples were aseptically collected from different sites in the direct drinking-water supply network. Clinical specimens were frozen, and food and water samples were stored at a cold temperature of 4 \u00b0C. The first case was recognized on 17 November 2014. Up to 5 January 2015, a total of 1614 cases were identified. Figure 1 shows the distribution of cases by date of symptom onset. Of 926 patients with complete case information, 56.5% (523/926) were males. Only 0.76% (7/926) were teachers. Of 406 cases diagnosed at the school clinic, nausea (80.1%) was reported to be the most common symptom, followed by abdominal pain (69.7%), vomiting (66.5%), diarrhoea (56.4%) and headache (52.2%). Symptoms in most cases were mild, and cases recovered 1\u20132 days after treatment. In total, 402 individuals were included in the retrospective cohort study. No significant difference of AR was observed in 12 foodborne risk factors. However, the AR was significantly higher in those exposed to unboiled direct drinking water than those unexposed (38.5% vs. 28.1%). Table 1 shows the results of statistical analysis for suspected risk factors.
