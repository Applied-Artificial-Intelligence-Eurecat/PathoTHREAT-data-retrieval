From August 15, 2015 to March 5, 2016, Tanzania reported 16,521 cholera cases and 251 deaths, with 4,596 cases and 44 deaths in its largest city, Dar es Salaam. To evaluate outbreak response efforts, we conducted a household survey with drinking water testing in the five most affected wards in Dar es Salaam. We interviewed 641 households 6 months after the beginning of the outbreak. Although most respondents knew that cholera causes diarrhea (90%) and would seek care if suspecting cholera (95%), only 45% were aware of the current outbreak in the area and only 5% would use oral rehydration salts (ORS) if ill. Of 200 (31%) respondents reporting no regular water treatment, 46% believed treatment was unnecessary and 18% believed treatment was too expensive. Fecal contamination was found in 45% of water samples and was associated with water availability (P = 0.047). Only 11% of samples had detectable free chlorine residual, which was associated with water availability (P = 0.025), reported current water treatment (P = 0.006), and observed free chlorine product in the household (P = 0.015). The provision of accessible, adequately chlorinated water supply, and implementation of social mobilization campaigns advocating household water treatment and use of ORS should be prioritized to address gaps in cholera prevention and treatment activities. During the past several years, large cholera outbreaks have affected East African countries including Tanzania, Kenya, Ethiopia, Somalia, and Mozambique.13-17 Cholera is endemic to Tanzania with cases reported every year since 1977.18 The largest country-wide outbreak in Tanzania occurred in 1997, resulting in a total of 40,249 cases and 2,231 deaths.18 In August 2015, a case of laboratory-confirmed cholera infection in Tanzania was reported in Dar es Salaam, the initial epicenter of the epidemic, where the majority of the population resides in informal settlements; the case count rapidly rose to 3,371 cases and 36 deaths in Dar es Salaam by the end of October 2015, before spreading to other areas of the country over the next few months.15 In February 2016, a cross-sectional household survey including drinking water testing was conducted in the five wards in Dar es Salaam with the highest cholera case counts during the peak of the epidemic in October 2015. At the time of each interview, the enumerator also asked the respondent to direct him or her to the pharmacy that was the household\u2019s usual source of medications or water treatment products. The enumerator then visited the pharmacy and queried.
