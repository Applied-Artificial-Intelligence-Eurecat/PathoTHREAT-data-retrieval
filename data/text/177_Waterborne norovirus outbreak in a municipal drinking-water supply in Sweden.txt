During Easter 2009, almost 200 people resident in a small Swedish village fell ill with gastrointestinal symptoms. We conducted a retrospective cohort study and a molecular investigation in order to identify the source of the outbreak. Residents living in households connected to the public water network were at an increased risk of developing disease (relative risk 4.80, 95% confidence interval 1.68-13.73) compared to those with no connection to the public network. Norovirus genotype GI.3 was identified in stool samples from six patients and in a sample from the public water network. Contamination of one of the wells supplying the public water network was thought to be the source of the outbreak. This is a description of a norovirus outbreak linked to a municipal drinking-water supply in Sweden. Information from epidemiological and molecular investigations is of utmost importance to guide outbreak control measures and to prevent future outbreaks. On 15 April 2009, the Environmental Office (EO) in a municipality in Western Sweden was informed of several cases of vomiting and diarrhoea in a village during the Easter weekend. The EO contacted the County Medical Office (CMO) the same day. In the initial investigation, over 60 households reported at least one member ill with vomiting and/or diarrhoea. These households were distributed throughout the village, which is located in the mountains in Western Sweden and has a population of around 400. Sixty-seven water samples taken in different locations and at different time points were obtained and investigated for E. coli, coliforms, intestinal enterococci and Clostridium perfringens at the county laboratory. Out of a total of 155 households, 116 returned the completed questionnaire (75% response rate). The questionnaires contained information about 270 individuals (including guests) which constituted our study cohort. Of these, 173 individuals fulfilled the case definition, giving an AR of 64%. The median age of cases was 48 years (range 0-85 years) and 50% of the cases were male. There were no significant differences in age and sex between cases and non-cases. Of the 173 cases, 88% presented with diarrhoea, 84% with abdominal pain, 75% with vomiting and 50% with fever. The median duration of illness was 46 h (range 2-154 h). From 15 April to 7 May, 67 water samples were taken for analysis : nine from water source A (eight raw water, one treated water), 10 from water source B (nine raw water, one treated water), two samples from the community centre, two samples from the day-care centre and 44 samples from 19 households connected to the public water network where cases had occurred (15 households were sampled once and four households were sampled repeatedly with a total of 29 samples). The analysis of a sample of treated water from water source B on 15 April had 5 c.f.u./100 ml coliforms and no E. coli. A water sample taken the same day from the home of a user had 12 c.f.u./100 ml coliforms and 2 c.f.u./100 ml E. coli. Samples taken after 15 April were mostly negative for coliforms except for four raw water samples from water source B (2-6 c.f.u./100 ml).
