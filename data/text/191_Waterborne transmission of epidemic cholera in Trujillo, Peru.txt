The epidemic of cholera that began in Peru in January, 1991, marked the first such epidemic in South America this century. Subsequently, over 533 000 cases and 4700 deaths have been reported from nineteen countries in that hemisphere. We investigated the epidemic in Trujillo, the second largest city in Peru. Trujillo's water supply was unchlorinated and water contamination was common. Suspect cholera cases were defined as persons presenting to a health facility with acute diarrhoea between Feb 1, and March 31, 1991. We studied a cohort of 150 patients who had been admitted to hospital and conducted a matched case-control study with 46 cases and 65 symptom-free and serologically uninfected controls; we also carried out a water quality study. By March 31, 1991, 16 400 cases of suspected cholera (attack rate 2.6%), 6673 hospital admissions, and 71 deaths (case-fatality rate 0.4%) had been reported in the province of Trujillo. 79% of stool cultures of patients with diarrhoea presenting to a single hospital yielded Vibrio cholerae O1. In the case-control study, drinking unboiled water (odds ratio [OR] 3.1, 95% confidence interval [Cl] 1.3-7.3), drinking water from a household water storage container in which hands had been introduced into the water (4.2, 1.2-1.9), and going to a fiesta (social event) (3.6, 1.1-1.1) were associated with illness. The water quality study showed progressive contamination during distribution and storage in the home: faecal coliform counts were highest in water from household storage containers and lowest in city well water. V cholerae 01, biotype El Tor, serotype Inaba, was isolated from three city water samples. In early February, 1991, cases of severe watery diarrhoea were reported in Trujillo (population 322 944), the second largest city in Peru (fig 1); within 2 weeks, several hundred patients presented daily to health facilities. Cases were initially concentrated in poorer neighbourhoods and the epidemic spread from inner city areas to peripheral and rural regions. In mid-March, epidemic activity was especially severe in a newly affected city neighbourhood, Victor Larco (population 31 930), resulting in 20-30 patient visits a day to Belen Hospital, the largest hospital in Trujillo. The National University of Trujillo and the Municipal Water Services, Trujillo, documented bacteriological contamination of water in a study conducted in February, 1991. Of fifty water samples from the distribution system, 60% contained coliform bacteria, 14% had faecal coliforms with counts of up to 1800 faecal coliforms/ 100 ml, and three samples (6%) yielded V cholerae 01. Of fifty-two samples from city wells, coliforms were detected in 19% and faecal coliforms in 13% (unpublished data). In some parts of the city, untreated sewage obtained through clandestine diversion from sewer lines is used to irrigate crops including cabbage, lettuce, carrots, and watermelon. 150 consecutive patients were interviewed. Age range was 2 months to 86 years (mean 32 years); 73 (49%) were male. The interval from onset of symptoms to hospital arrival varied from < 1 to 109 h (median 12 h). Before arriving at the hospital, 84 patients (56%) were treated with oral rehydration salts and 20 (13%) with homemade rehydration solutions. 13 patients (9%) had taken an antimicrobial drug before arriving at the hospital. V cholerae 01, serotype Inaba, was isolated from 98 (79%) (95% CI 72-86%) of 124 patients from whom stool samples were obtained and who had not taken an antimicrobial drug before admission. 83 patients (55%) were admitted to an observation ward for treatment with oral and/or intravenous rehydration, 54 (36%) were admitted to hospital for at least 24 h, and 12 (8%) were treated with oral rehydration as outpatients. There were no deaths.
