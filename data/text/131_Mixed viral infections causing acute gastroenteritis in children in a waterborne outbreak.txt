We examined stool specimens for viral pathogens from 50 children referred to hospital due to acute gastroenteritis (AGE) resulting from consuming drinking water contaminated with sewage in a Finnish community using PCR methods. Rotavirus was detected in 33 (66%), human calicivirus in 31 (62%), and both in 40% of cases. Of the caliciviruses, 20/31 (65%) were noroviruses and 11 (35%) sapoviruses. Furthermore, Aichi virus was detected in 25 (50%), adenovirus in six (12%) and bocavirus in four (8%) cases. Campylobacter jejuni was present in 20 (61%) and Salmonella in four (12%) of the 33 stools cultured for bacteria. On a 20-point scale median severity score of AGE in the 28 hospitalized children was 17; the severity was similar regardless of viruses detected. Bloody diarrhoea occurred only when C. jejuni was present. To conclude, massive exposure to several AGE viruses caused mixed infections and severe AGE regardless of the aetiological agents. An outbreak of AGE due to contamination of drinking water with sewage occurred near Tampere in late 2007. We investigated cases of AGE in children from the contaminated area seen in Tampere University Hospital between 28 November and 31 December 2007, and examined the stool specimens for various causative agents. Drinking water was contaminated with treated sewage on 28 November 2007 in Nokia, a town of about 30 000 inhabitants near Tampere in southern Finland. It was estimated that thousands of people had symptoms of AGE, and at least 758 patients visited public health centres [23] in the following days and weeks. A total of 115 children requiring rehydration therapy were referred to Tampere University Hospital. Of the eligible 115 children, 35 (30%) were hospitalized and 80 (70%) were treated as outpatients with one or more visits. We enrolled 65 children; 28 were hospitalized and 37 treated as outpatients. The age of enrolled children ranged from 6 months to 13 years (median age 2 years 6 months). There were 19 children aged >7 years (Fig. 1).
