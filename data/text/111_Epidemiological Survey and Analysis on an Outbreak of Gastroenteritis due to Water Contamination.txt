Objective To document the investigation and control of an outbreak of gastroenteritis in City G, South China, and provide a reference for preventing future outbreaks. Methods An ambispective cohort study was designed. Attack rate (AR) and relative risks (RR) were calculated to identify the causes of gastroenteritis. Investigations using questionnaires included personal interviews with patients and doctors, reviews of medical records, laboratory examinations of fecal specimens and continuous hygiene monitoring of water samples from the waterworks. Results Overall, 427/71534 (AR=5.97%) cases were identified between October 31 and November 12 2010. Geographic distribution was highly localized, with 80% of cases occurring in the areas supplied by waterworks\u2010A. Consumption of water provided solely by waterworks\u2010A was found to be associated with illness (RR=8.20, 95 CI%:6.12-10.99) compared with that from waterworks\u2010B. Microbiological analyses confirmed the presence of Norovirus in six of eight fecal samples from symptomatic patients, two water samples from waterworks\u2010A and two sewage samples. After taking effective measures, the hygienic indices of waterworks\u2010A met health criteria again on November 9 and no cases were reported 3 days later. Conclusion The outbreak reported here was caused by drinking tap water contaminated with sewage at the source. Early identification of possible contamination sources and awareness of changes that might negatively impact water quality are important preventive measures to protect public health. Doctors in the hospital found the number of alimentary tract cases increased abnormally from October 31 and reported this to the local Center for Disease Control (CDC) on November 5. The local CDC began to investigate immediately and continued until the end of the outbreak. The age-specific AR was highest among those 1-5 year group, and lowest in the 6-15 year old age group, giving a significant difference among different age groups (\u03c7 2 =69.04, P<0.01) (Table 1). From November 11 no new cases appeared, no epidemic occurred in schools or other crowed units and no severe hospitalization or deaths from gastroenteritis were recorded.
