In 2015, a typhoid fever outbreak began in downtown Kampala, Uganda, and spread into adjacent districts. In response, an environmental survey of drinking water source types was conducted in areas of the city with high case numbers. A total of 122 samples was collected from 12 source types and tested for Escherichia coli, free chlorine, and conductivity. An additional 37 grab samples from seven source types and 16 paired large volume (20 liter) samples from wells and springs were also collected and tested for the presence of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi. Escherichia coli was detected in 60% of kaveras (drinking water sold in plastic bags) and 80% of refilled water bottles; free chlorine was not detected in either source type. Most jerry cans (68%) contained E. coli and had free chlorine residuals below the WHO-recommended level of 0.5 mg/liter during outbreaks. Elevated conductivity readings for kaveras, refilled water bottles, and jerry cans (compared to treated surface water supplied by the water utility) suggested that they likely contained untreated groundwater. All unprotected springs and wells and more than 60% of protected springs contained E. coli. Water samples collected from the water utility were found to have acceptable free chlorine levels and no detectable E. coli. While S. Typhi was not detected in water samples, Salmonella spp. were detected in samples from two unprotected springs, one protected spring, and one refilled water bottle. These data provided clear evidence that unregulated vended water and groundwater represented a risk for typhoid transmission. Typhoid fever is caused by ingestion of food or drink contaminated with Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi). Symptoms include high fever, malaise, headache, abdominal pain, and constipation or diarrhea, and can lead to serious intestinal complications and death if untreated. Kampala is the capital city and financial center of Uganda. The city is a dense urban environment with a population of more than 1.5 million people (4). In early 2015, a typhoid fever outbreak began in the downtown area and subsequently spread throughout the city and into adjacent districts. By June, more than 10,000 suspected cases had been reported throughout the five districts in Kampala. The attack rate was higher in males (11.0/1,000 residents) than in females (8.4/1,000 resident) and higher in adults 15 to 59 (12.0/1,000 residents) than in children under 15 (2.0/1,000 residents) (5). The World Health Organization (WHO) reported that contaminated drinking water and juices were the main sources of the outbreak and that most water sources tested were heavily contaminated with Escherichia coli, with groundwater being of the worst quality (see http://www.who.int/csr/don/17-march-2015-uganda/en/). This was supported by a small-scale study conducted in early April 2015 that detected evidence of fecal contamination in street-vended beverages and in unprotected spring water sources (5). No total coliforms or E. coli were detected in the NWSC reservoirs, booster station, or water distribution system lines (pretap) (Table 2). The non-NWSC reservoir contained a high concentration of total coliforms (>2,419.6 most probable number [MPN]/100 ml), but no detectable E. coli. Approximately one-quarter of non-NWSC taps contained low mean concentrations of both total coliforms (5.2 MPN/100 ml) and E. coli (1.6 MPN/100 ml). Total coliforms were detected in two (15%) manufacturer-packaged water bottles (at 2 and 18.9 MPN/100 ml); the former contained 1 E. coli MPN/100 ml. Nearly all refilled water bottles (n = 14, 93%) and kaveras (n = 24, 96%) contained total coliforms. Twelve (80%) refilled water bottles contained E. coli, four of which (33%) contained >1,000 MPN/100 ml. Nearly two-thirds (n = 15, 60%) of kaveras contained E. coli with more than half (n = 13) at a concentration of 1 to 10 MPN/100 ml. All jerry cans contained total coliforms and 68% contained E. coli (mean, 24.2 MPN/100 ml); four of which contained >1,000 E. coli MPN/100 ml. All springs and wells contained total coliforms. The mean E. coli concentration in protected springs was 10.3 MPN/100 ml; 2 (15%) contained E. coli at >1,000 MPN/100 ml. All unprotected springs and wells contained E. coli, with approximately two-thirds of each containing >1,000 MPN/100 ml. While consumption of unsafe drinking water is often implicated in waterborne disease outbreaks in low-income regions, well-timed drinking water quality testing is not always performed. Drinking water quality investigations may help identify sources with fecal contamination and possibly even those containing the etiologic agent implicated in the outbreak. This information can assist in prompt interventions (e.g., distribution of point-of-use water treatments) and policy changes (e.g., stricter regulations on the selling of water from unregulated sources). Comprehensive environmental evaluations such as this require strong partnerships with in-country collaborators, particularly with municipal water authorities and governmental organizations that oversee water supplies, as these groups provide valuable knowledge of water practices and location of (and access to) water sources.
