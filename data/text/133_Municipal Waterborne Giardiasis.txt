In March 1976, 128 persons in Camas, Washington, had laboratory-confirmed giardiasis. A questionnaire survey of 498 Camas residents revealed that 3.8% had clinical giardiasis, while none of 318 residents in a control town were ill. No associations between illness and sex, pet ownership, travel, time spent in wilderness areas, public gatherings, or food preference were found. Giardia cysts were recovered from raw water entering the city water treatment system via two streams and also from two storage reservoirs containing chlorinated and filtered stream water. Failure to remove Giardia cysts was attributed to the water plants' inadequate flocculation, coagulation, and sedimentation combined with deterioration of the filter media. Investigation of the watershed revealed no signs of human fecal contamination. Animal trapping in the watershed area yielded three beavers (Castor canadensis) infected with Giardia that were infective for specific pathogen-free beagle pups. In March 1976, an internist in Camas noticed that an unusually large number of his patients complained of persistent diarrhea. Stool cultures for pathogenic bacteria (Yersinia, Salmonella, and Shigella) and viruses (adenovirus and enterovirus) were negative, but all 12 of his patients were found by stool examination to be infected with Giardia organisms. A review of the three hospitals' laboratory records revealed that 128 laboratory-confirmed cases of giardiasis had been diagnosed between 1 April and 1 June 1976. Of the 128 patients, 81 (64%) were contacted by telephone and medical histories obtained. The earliest cases had onset of diarrhea in the first week of April. The number of cases peaked during the first week of May (Figure 3).
