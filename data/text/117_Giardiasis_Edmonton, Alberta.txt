In January 1983, the Edmonton Local Board of Health noticed an increase in the number of positive identifications of G. lamblia cysts in stools. Accordingly, the Medical Officer of Health. requested local medical laboratories to provide notification of any positive report of G. lamblia and a formal investigation was undertaken. Laboratories were subsequently asked to provide information on all positive cases identified since October in order to more readily identify the onset of the outbreak. Questionnaires were mailed to 234 cases who were identified from laboratory reports after 24 February. Each adult was asked to give the same questionnaire to 2 friends who had not been ill (the control group). Controls were not sought for the child cases. Questions were asked about symptoms, source of drinking water, personal eating and travelling habits, living accommodations, and types of pets. The investigation revealed that there had been 895 positive reports of giardiasis between October 198.2 and April 1983. Analysis of these reports indicated that the outbreak had occurred between December 1982 and April 1983. The epidemic curve (Figure 1) showed a rapid accumulation of cases in early January, a peak in February, and a gradual decline in March and April. Analysis of incidence rates by census tract indicated that census tracts with a rate >100 cases (per 100 000 population) were serviced by the central water treatment facility. Moreover, areas with a rate >300 were closest to that facility, but areas with the lowest rates were also serviced by it. There was no clustering of cases around the west end facility. The median duration of illness was 6.2 weeks. The most common symptoms were fatigue, diarrhea, bloating, nausea, abdominal pain, and flatulence. Approximately 60% of the cases were aged 20-34 years; 15% were over 50 years of age. Seventy-one percent (71 %) were females.
