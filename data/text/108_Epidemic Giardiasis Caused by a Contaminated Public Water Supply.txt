In the period November 1, 1985 to January 31, 1986, 703 cases of giardiasis were reported in Pittsfield, Massachusetts (population 50,265). The community obtained its water from two main reservoirs (A and B) and an auxiliary reservoir (C). Potable water was chlorinated but not filtered. The incidence of illness peaked approximately two weeks after the city began obtaining a major portion of its water from reservoir C, which had not been used for three years. The attack rate of giardiasis for residents of areas supplied by reservoir C was 14.3/1000, compared with 7.0/1000 in areas that received no water from reservoir C. A case-control study showed that persons with giardiasis were more likely to be older and to have drunk more municipal water than household controls. A community telephone survey indicated that over 3,800 people could have had diarrhea that might have been caused by Giardia, and 95 per cent of households were either using alternate sources of drinking water or boiling municipal water. Environmental studies identified Giardia cysts in the water of reservoir C. Cysts were also detected in the two other reservoirs supplying the city, but at lower concentrations. This investigation highlights the risk of giardiasis associated with unfiltered surface water systems. (Am J Public Health 1988; 78:139-143.) The outbreak occurred in the western Massachusetts city of Pittsfield (population, 50,265, 1985 census). The problem was first recognized during the first week of December 1985, when the health department of Pittsfield received 70 reports of laboratory-confirmed giardiasis. Only 53 positive stool samples for Giardia had been submitted during the entire one-year prior to November 1, 1985. Interviews of the 70 case-patients revealed that they had negative stool cultures for bacterial enteric pathogens, no common personal contact, and they were widely distributed throughout the city. This information, coupled with the knowledge that a new reservoir had been added to the community water supply in November, led city and state health officials to suspect a waterborne outbreak of giardiasis. Sampling for Giardia cysts was performed using volume-sampling orlon yarn filters supplied by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).6 Analysis of water samples for Giardia was also performed by the EPA using an immunofluorescent antibody technique.7 Giardia cysts extracted from the water samples obtained from each of the three reservoirs were tested for infectivity by inoculation in gerbils. 8 Giardia trophozoites obtained from these animals were then examined at the University of Minnesota by scanning electron microscopy for morphological characteristics in order to determine whether they were from human or animal origin. Of the 200 households interviewed, 189 (95 per cent) reported continuous compliance with a boil-water order that had been issued on December 12; 78 (39 per cent) were boiling municipal water, and 111 (56 per cent) were either using commercial bottled water or were obtaining water from local springs or wells. All respondents indicated awareness of the outbreak and the boil-water order. Among the 139 households interviewed, we identified 147 persons with laboratory-confirmed giardiasis (cases) and 239 persons who had neither diarrhea nor positive stool samples for Giardia (controls). Seventy-three per cent (108/147) of cases reported drinking two or more glasses of municipal water per day, compared to 36 per cent (86/239) of controls (OR = 4.9 95% CI = 3.1-8.0). Eighty-eight per cent (130/147) of cases were age 20 years or older, compared with 52 per cent (124/239) of controls (OR = 7.1 95% CI = 3.9-13.3). Conditional logistic regression analysis, used to match cases and controls by household and to control for age and water consumption, indicated that drinking two or more glasses of unboiled municipal water per day and being age 20 years or older were independently associated with giardiasis [OR (water) = 9.2 95% CI = 4.2-19.9; OR (age) = 3.3 95% CI = 1.74.2]. During October 1985, all bacterial cultures of water samples from various points in the distribution system contained levels of coliform bacteria below the acceptable limit of 4 colony forming units (CFU)/100 ml; no bacteria were detectable in 71 of 80 samples. However, on November 19, five days after the episode of turbid water (observed but not measured), five of 17 samples had > 5 CFU/100 ml. All of these five samples were taken from areas of the city that were at least partially supplied by water from reservoir C. Sampling was performed daily for the next seven days; after two days, all samples were negative for coliform bacteria except for a single site located in the region served exclusively by reservoir C, which continued yielding elevated coliform counts (8-41 CFU per 100 ml) until December 1, when the defective chlorinator was repaired.
