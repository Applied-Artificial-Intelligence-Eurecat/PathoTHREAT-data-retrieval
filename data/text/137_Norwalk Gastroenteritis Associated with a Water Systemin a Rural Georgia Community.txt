An outbreak of acute gastroenteritis occurred during January 4-9, 1982, in a rural community in north Georgia, A systematic telephone survey revealed that 63% of persons living in homes served by the community water system had symptoms of acute gastroenteritis in contrast to 9% of persons in homes served by private wells or other sources (p < .001). A fourfold rise in antibody titer to the Norwalk virus occurred in 20 of 22 serum pairs obtained from ill persons. Fecal coliforms (> 16 MPN/100 ml) were detected in a spring which served as one water source for the community system. Surface runoff from a heavy rainfall, which preceded the outbreak, may have contaminated the system. Outbreaks of gastroenteritis should be promptly reported and investigated to facilitate corrective measures and to identify causative agents such as Norwalk virus. On January 2 and 3, 1982, the town of Tate received approximately 4.5 in of rainfall. On January 4, residents in the approximately 250 homes served by the community water system noted that their tap water appeared turbid and that evening the first cases of gastrointestinal illness occurred. On the morning of January 7, water entering the distribution system was superchlorinated to a level of approximately 10 ppm chlorine. The investigation included interviews of ill persons and testing of serum and stool samples, a community telephone survey, and evaluation of the water system. An outbreak-associated case of gastroenteritis was defined as the acute onset of vomiting and/or diarrhea (\u2265 1 watery stool/day) during the period January 1-9.
