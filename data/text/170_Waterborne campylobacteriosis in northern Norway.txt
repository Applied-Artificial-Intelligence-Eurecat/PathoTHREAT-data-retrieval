A suspected waterborne outbreak of presumed campylobacteriosis involving approximately 680 of the 1000 inhabitants in a community is described. Twenty-two stratns of CampylobacrerJeJunr were Isolated from patterns. Ten randomly chosen Isolates were identified as biotype 1 LAU 0: 1 (n = 9) and biotype 2 PEN 0 : 6,7 (n = 1) and one from tap water as btotype 1 PEN 0 : 19.22. The maJority of cases occurred within a period of 1 week. Examination of human sera obtained during the first 2 weeks of the epidemic (n - 38) revealed two patients producing antibodies directed only agamst the water isolate. The majority (89%) of sera collected 4 weeks later (n = 18) had antibodies directed against the most common human isolate. We suggest that all three serotypes of C. ,e,unr were involved in this outbreak, stressing the need for continuous surveillance and treatment of public drinking water sources. In the period 10 June-15 July, 1984, approximately 680 human cases of campylobacteriosis were reported in Alsvhg, a small community in northern Norway with almost 1000 inhabitants. Most of the patients suffered from diarrhoea and abdominal pain. More than 40% of the patients had fever but none were hospitalized. In this paper we present the investigations carried out to suggest that the outbreak of campylobacteriosis was waterborne. Faecal specimens from 27 patients were subjected to analysis for C. jejuni and C. cob by plating on a modified Skirrow's medium (Melby et al., 1985). All plates were incubated for at least 48 h in a microaerophilic atmosphere in a Gas Pak jar (BBL, Cockeysville, MD, U.S.A.) without catalyst at 43 \u00b0 C. The majority (80%) of cases occurred over a 10 day period. Diarrhoea was the most common initial symptom of the illness reported by 82.3% of the patients followed by abdominal pains reported by 62.8% and fever by 41.8%. From approximately May 25, for 2-3 weeks before the outbreak sheep grazing the area provided an opportunity for dissemination of campylobacters into the drinking water. Contamination was indicated by significant increase of fecal coliforms (44\u00b0C) and coliforms (37\u00b0C) in the water before and during the outbreak (data not included).
